       What is
       <span>
        MILC
       </span>
       ?
      </h2>
      <p>
       Welt der Wunder TV is creating a completely new blockchain-managed license, trading and sales platform for high-quality video content for international broadcasting, video-on-demand (VOD) and online video publishing sectors. The
       <strong>
        MILC

       token (
       <strong>
        MI
       </strong>

       </strong>
       icensing
       <strong>
        C
       </strong>
       oin) is a utility token and payment medium within the platform.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       In the future, the MILC platform will offer content owners the opportunity to easily provide their content to a global market with sales of $ 500 billion a year. Also the platform helps purchasers, advertisers and other users gain access to good motion picture material. From day one, customers have access to several thousand high-quality program hours, contributed to the project by Welt der Wunder TV.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There are two major innovations of the MILC platform â via blockchain handled and so automated billing and very secure contracting via smart contracts. This allows customers to conduct transactions directly with the owner or producer of content. This reduces intermediate distribution structures â and thus the price. The platform will also support innovative film projects. The first MILC funded film is already in the making, more projects are in planning.

       CONCLUSION
      </h2>
      <p>
       The MILC platform is unique in its kind and has the potential to become a standard in international licensing. Blockchain technology, combined with its own cryptocurrency, will make TV licensing sustainably safer, more effective and cheaper for producers and TV stations.

      The objective is to actively boost the value of the MILCs in addition to the platformâs business model. The system is issued a limited number of 40,000,000 MILCs. The integrated reserve of 25% is a second important factor. The purpose of this is to equip relevant partners of the platform (TV, VOD, publishers) with MILCs in order to incentivise trade in the currency.

         Most of the previous ICOs are StartUps, which have a good idea and vision, but the realization and success are first to be proven. Welt der Wunder has been part of the media industry for more than 20 years and a broadcast network with a German and a Swiss TV channel. The distribution platform is developed and used together with our partner Swiss TXT. With decades of experience, we donât enter a new market, but solve pain points by offering a sophisticated solution - with ongoing trading and good supply and demand.

         We see the tradability of tokens as an essential part of an ICO. From the regulator's point of view, a key issue in classifying tokens is "whether they are tradable or transferable from the very beginning of the ICO." Since the MILC is a utility token with a clear function on the platform, a listing during the ICO is not guaranteed and answered at the earliest after the ICO.

          The licensing, trading and distribution platform project is based on existing technology already in use at Welt der Wunder. Thus, the funds from the ICO flow into the expansion of the platform and the integration of blockchain technology. In addition, international distribution and promotion of the platform are an essential part of the use of funds. In the case of an "oversubscription" funds are invested in the realization of new programs.

       The internet pages of the Welt der Wunder Sendebetrieb GmbH use cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored and stored on a computer system via an Internet browser. Many websites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited websites and servers to distinguish the individual's browser from other internet browsers that contain other cookies. A particular web browser can be recognized and identified by the unique cookie ID. By using cookies, the Welt der Wunder Sendebetrieb GmbH can provide users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting. By means of a cookie the information and offers on our website can be optimized in the sense of the user. Cookies allow us, as already mentioned, to recognize the users of our website. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to use our website. For example, the user of a website that uses cookies need not reenter their credentials each time they visit the website, as this is done by the website and the cookie stored on the user's computer system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping basket in the online shop. The online shop remembers the items that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie. The data subject can prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently contradict the setting of cookies.

By registering on the website of the controller, the IP address assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) of the data subject, the date and time of registration are also stored. The storage of this data takes place against the background that only so the misuse of our services can be prevented, and these data in case of need make it possible to clarify committed offenses. In this respect, the storage of this data is required to secure the controller. A disclosure of these data to third parties is not, unless there is a legal obligation to pass on or the disclosure of law enforcement serves. By registering the data subject voluntarily providing personal data, the data controller serves to provide the data subject with content or services that, due to the nature of the case, can only be offered to registered users.

      <p>
       On the website of the Welt der Wunder Sendebetrieb GmbH the users are given the opportunity to receive the newsletter about our Subscribe to blockchain project. Which personal data are transmitted to the data controller when the newsletter is ordered results from the input mask used for this purpose.

The newsletter of our company can only be received by the data subject if (1) the data subject has a valid email address and (2) the data subject registers for the newsletter. For legal reasons, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address entered by an affected person for the first time for newsletter mailing using the double-opt-in procedure. This confirmation email is used to check whether the owner of the e-mail address as the person concerned authorized the receipt of the newsletter. When subscribing to the newsletter, we also store the IP address of the computer system used by the person concerned at the time of registration, as well as the date and time of registration, as assigned by the Internet Service Provider (ISP). The collection of this data is necessary in order to understand the (possible) misuse of an affected person's e-mail address at a later date and therefore serves as legal safeguards for the controller. The personal data collected in the context of registering for the newsletter will be used exclusively to send our newsletter. Subscribers to the newsletter may also be notified by e-mail if this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or registration, as might be the case in the event of changes to the newsletter or technical changes. There will be no transfer of the personal data collected as part of the newsletter service to third parties. Subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by the person concerned at any time. The consent to the storage of personal data that the data subject has given us for the newsletter dispatch can be revoked at any time. For the purpose of revoking the consent, there is a corresponding link in each newsletter. It is also possible to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time, directly on the controller's website, or to inform the controller in a different way.

       7. Newsletter tracking
      </h3>
      <p>
       The newsletters of the Welt der Wunder Sendebetrieb GmbH, which are sent by MailChimp, contain so-called counting pixels. A counting pixel is a miniature graphic that is embedded in such emails that are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and log file analysis. This allows a statistical evaluation of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns. With the help of the embedded pixel, the Welt der Wunder Sendebetrieb GmbH, in cooperation with MailChimp, can detect if and when an e-mail was opened by a data subject and which links in the e-mail were accessed by the person concerned. Such personal data collected via the counting pixels contained in the newsletters are stored by MailChimp and evaluated by us in order to optimize the newsletter distribution and to better adapt the content of future newsletters to the interests of the person concerned. This personal data will not be disclosed to third parties. Affected persons are at any time entitled to revoke the separate declaration of consent made via the double-opt-in procedure. After revocation, this personal data will be deleted by the controller. A deregistration from receipt of the newsletter, the Welt der Wunder Sendebetrieb GmbH automatically indicates a withdrawal.

       13. Privacy Policy for Use and operation of Google AdSense
      </h3>
      <p>
       The controller has integrated Google AdSense on this website. Google AdSense is an online service that provides third-party advertising mediation. Google AdSense is based on an algorithm that selects advertisements displayed on third-party websites in accordance with the contents of the respective third-party website. Google AdSense allows interest-based targeting of the Internet user, which is implemented by generating individual user profiles.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The operating company of the Google AdSense component is the Alphabet Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The purpose of the Google AdSense component is to include advertisements on our website. Google AdSense sets a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. What cookies are, has already been explained above. By using this cookie, Alphabet Inc. provides an analysis of the use of our website. Each visit to one of the pages of this site operated by the controller and incorporating a Google AdSense component automatically initiates the Internet browser on the information technology system of the person concerned through the respective Google AdSense component To submit data to Alphabet Inc. for purposes of online advertising and commission settlement. As part of this technical process, Alphabet Inc. gains knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address of the data subject, which is used by Alphabet Inc., inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks and, as a result, to facilitate commission settlement.

In addition, a cookie already set by Alphabet Inc. can be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Google AdSense also uses so-called counting pixels. A counting pixel is a miniature graphic that is embedded in web pages to enable log file recording and log file analysis, whereby a statistical evaluation can be performed. Based on the embedded pixel count, Alphabet Inc. can detect if and when an internet page was opened by an affected person and which links the affected person clicked on. Counting pixels are used, among other things, to evaluate the flow of visitors to a website.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Google AdSense will transfer personal information and information, including the IP address required to collect and bill the displayed advertising, to Alphabet Inc. in the United States of America.

       14. Privacy Policy for the use and use of Google Analytics (with anonymization function)
      </h3>
      <p>
       The controller has integrated on this website the component Google Analytics (with anonymization function). Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analysis is the collection, collection and analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to websites. Among other things, a web analysis service collects data on which website an affected person has come to a website (so-called referrers), which subpages of the website were accessed or how often and for which length of stay a subpage was viewed. A web analysis is mainly used to optimize a website and cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The operating company of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The controller uses the addition "_gat._anonymizeIp" for web analytics via Google Analytics. By means of this addendum, the IP address of the Internet access of the data subject will be shortened and anonymised by Google if the access to our website is from a Member State of the European Union or from another state party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze visitor flows on our website. Among other things, Google uses the data and information obtained to evaluate the use of our website, to compile for us online reports showing the activities on our websites, and to provide other services related to the use of our website.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Google Analytics uses a cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned. What cookies are, has already been explained above. By using this cookie Google is enabled to analyze the usage of our website. Each time one of the pages of this website is accessed by the controller and a Google Analytics component has been integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the person concerned is automatically initiated by the respective Google Analytics component To submit data to Google for online analysis purposes. As part of this technical process, Google will be aware of personal data, such as the IP address of the person concerned, which serve, among other things, Google to track the origin of the visitors and clicks, and subsequently make commission settlements possible.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The cookie stores personally identifiable information, such as access time, the location from which access was made, and the frequency of site visits by the data subject. Each time you visit our website, your personal information, including the IP address of the Internet connection used by the data subject, is transferred to Google in the United States of America. This personal information is stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may transfer such personal data collected through the technical process to third parties.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The affected person can prevent the setting of cookies through our website, as shown above, at any time by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently contradict the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned. In addition, a cookie already set by Google Analytics can be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Furthermore, the data subject has the option of objecting to and preventing the collection of the data generated by Google Analytics for the use of this website and the processing of this data by Google. To do this, the person must download and install a browser add-on at
       <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">
        https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
       </a>
       . This browser add-on informs Google Analytics via JavaScript that no data and information about website visits may be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-on is considered by Google as a contradiction. If the data subject's information technology system is later deleted, formatted or reinstalled, the data subject must re-install the browser add-on to disable Google Analytics. If the browser add-on is uninstalled or disabled by the data subject or any other person within their sphere of control, it is possible to reinstall or reactivate the browser add-on.

       <br/>
       <br/>
       DoubleClick by Google transmits data to the DoubleClick server with every impression, click, or other activity. Each of these data transfers triggers a cookie request to the affected person's browser. If the browser accepts this request, DoubleClick sets a cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned. What cookies are, has already been explained above. The purpose of the cookie is to optimize and display advertising. The cookie is used, among other things, to serve and display user-relevant advertisements, as well as to generate reports on advertising campaigns or to improve them. Furthermore, the cookie is used to avoid multiple impressions of the same advertising.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       DoubleClick uses a cookie ID required to complete the technical process. For example, the cookie ID is needed to display an ad in a browser. DoubleClick can also use the cookie ID to see which ads have already appeared in a browser to avoid duplication. DoubleClick also allows the cookie ID to track conversions. Conversions are captured, for example, when a user has previously shown a DoubleClick ad and then, with the same internet browser, makes a purchase on the advertiser's website.
       <br/>

       Each time one of the pages of this website is accessed by the controller and a DoubleClick component is integrated, the Internet browser on the subject's information technology system is automatically prompted by the relevant DoubleClick component for purposes to submit online advertising and commission billing to Google. As part of this technical process, Google will be aware of data that Google uses to create commission billing. Google can understand, among other things, that the person has clicked on certain links on our website.

       The affected person can prevent the setting of cookies through our website, as shown above, at any time by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently contradict the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned. In addition, cookies already set by Google can be deleted at any time via an internet browser or other software programs.

       20. Legal basis of processing
      </h3>
      <p>
       Art. 6 I lit. A DS-GMO serves our company as the legal basis for processing operations where we obtain consent for a particular processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary to fulfill a contract of which the data subject is a party, as is the case, for example, in processing operations necessary for the supply of goods or the provision of any other service or consideration, processing shall be based on Art. 6 I lit. b DS-GMO. The same applies to processing operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures, for example in cases of inquiries regarding our products or services. If our company is subject to a legal obligation which requires the processing of personal data, such as the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. c DS-GMO. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be required to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor to our premises were injured and his or her name, age, health insurance or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6 I lit. d DS-GMO are based. Ultimately, processing operations could be based on Art. 6 I lit. f DS-GMOs are based. On this legal basis, processing operations that are not covered by any of the above legal bases are required if processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of our company or a third party, unless the interests, fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms of the person concerned prevail. Such processing operations are particularly allowed to us because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. In that regard, it considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a customer of the controller (recital 47, second sentence, DS-BER).
      </p>
      <h3>
       21. Eligible processing interests that are being pursued by the controller or a third party
      </h3>
      <p>
       Is the processing of personal data based on Article 6 I lit. f DS-GMO is our legitimate interest in conducting our business for the benefit of all of our employees and our shareholders.
      </p>
      <h3>
       22. Duration for which the personal data is stored
      </h3>
      <p>
       The criterion for the duration of the storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period. After the deadline, the corresponding data will be routinely deleted, if they are no longer required to fulfill the contract or to initiate a contract.
      </p>
      <h3>
       23. Legal or contractual provisions for the provision of personal data; Necessity for the conclusion of the contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of non-provision
      </h3>
      <p>
       We clarify that the provision of personal information is in part required by law (such as tax regulations) or may result from contractual arrangements (such as details of the contractor). Occasionally it may be necessary for a contract to be concluded that an affected person provides us with personal data that must subsequently be processed by us. For example, the data subject is required to provide us with personal information when our company enters into a contract with her. Failure to provide the personal data would mean that the contract with the person concerned could not be closed. Prior to any personal data being provided by the person concerned, the person concerned must contact one of our employees. Our employee will inform the individual on a case-by-case basis whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is required for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of the non-provision of the personal data.

       Art. 6 I lit. A DS-GMO serves our company as the legal basis for processing operations where we obtain consent for a particular processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary to fulfill a contract of which the data subject is a party, as is the case, for example, in processing operations necessary for the supply of goods or the provision of any other service or consideration, processing shall be based on Art. 6 I lit. b DS-GMO.

In rare cases, the processing of personal data might be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or any other person. As a responsible company, we waive automatic decision-making or profiling.

      </h3>
      <p>
       In order to render our content correctly and graphically appealing across browsers, we use script libraries and font libraries on this website, such as: Google Webfonts (
       <a href="https://www.google.com/webfonts/" target="_blank">
        https://www.google.com/webfonts/

       <br/>
       <br/>
       The call of script libraries or font libraries automatically triggers a connection to the operator of the library. It is theoretically possible - but currently also unclear whether and if so for what purposes - that operators of such libraries collect data.

      <p>
       Our website uses Google Conversion Tracking. If you have reached our website via an advertisement sent by Google, Google Adwords will set a cookie on your computer. The conversion tracking cookie is set when a user clicks on a Google-served ad. These cookies lose their validity after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. If the user visits certain pages on our website and the cookie has not expired, we and Google may recognize that the user clicked on the ad and was redirected to this page. Each Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. Cookies cannot be tracked through AdWords advertisers' websites. The information gathered using the conversion cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for AdWords advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking. Customers are told the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page. However, they do not receive information that personally identifies users.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       If you do not want to participate in the tracking, you can refuse the required setting of a cookie - for example via a browser setting that generally disables the automatic setting of cookies or sets your browser to block cookies from the domain "googleleadservices.com".

       32. Privacy Policy on Use and Use of Google Remarketing
      </h3>
      <p>
       The controller has integrated Google Remarketing services on this website. Google Remarketing is a feature of Google AdWords that allows a business to show advertisements to such internet users that have previously been on the company's website. The integration of Google Remarketing therefore allows a company to create user-friendly advertising and thus allow Internet users to display interest-based ads.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The Google Remarketing Services company is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The purpose of Google Remarketing is to show interest-based advertising. Google Remarketing allows us to display ads through the Google Network or view them on other websites tailored to the individual needs and interests of Internet users.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Google Remarketing places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. What cookies are, has already been explained above. By setting the cookie, Google will be able to recognize the visitor to our website, if he subsequently calls websites that are also members of the Google ad network. With each visit to a website on which Google Remarketing's service has been integrated, the person's Internet browser automatically identifies with Google. As part of this technical process, Google receives knowledge about personal data, such as the IP address or the surfing behavior of the user, which Google uses among other things to display interest-relevant advertising.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the websites visited by the data subject. Each time you visit our website, your personal information, including the IP address of the Internet connection used by the data subject, will be transferred to Google in the United States of America. This personal information is stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may transfer such personal data collected through the technical process to third parties.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The affected person can prevent the setting of cookies through our website, as shown above, at any time by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently contradict the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned. In addition, a cookie already set by Google Analytics can be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Furthermore, the data subject has the opportunity to object to Google's interest-based advertising. To do this, the person concerned must access the link www.google.com/settings/ads from each of the Internet browsers they use and make the desired settings there.
