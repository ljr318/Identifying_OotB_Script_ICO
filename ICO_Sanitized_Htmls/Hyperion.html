       Hyperion, a decentralized map platform, aims to achieve the “One Map” vision - to provide an unified view of global map data and service, and to make it universally accessible just like a public utility for 10B people. Built on the Spatial Consensus Protocol which encloses not just spatial information but also value transfer, Hyperion fundamentally redefines the way we create and consume map services, conforming to our first principles to make maps aggressively open and decentralized.

       The first ever truly privacy-aware map application built on strong cryptographic primitives. All map functions such as positioning and searching are computed locally at the phone. Your location trace will never leave your phone and you have the power to burn them all with just one click. Through our cryptographic library, you can even share a location to your friend with no other intermedia platforms learning where you are and where you want to go.

           The Open Street Map initiative allowed for wide community participation, providing free and open data. However, the underlying technology have not improved much since its inception 10 years ago. Furthermore, the open contribution model lacks social-economic structure, making difficult to govern and incentivize the community.

         Hyperion launched Titan Map Store, a map layer service market with rich location data, for map use in various scenarios. Titan Map Store aims to be easy-to-use and practical for daily applications suitable for everyone. Each map layer demonstrates POI details in major cities of the world. Join with us to a more personalized map experience!

         Value of Map Store
        </h4>
        <p>
         Titan is a consumer-facing map product that offers more convenience in daily commute, and entertainment. Traditional Internet users can experience the power of decentralized map without any threshold. It aims to provide a trusted and personalized every day map without breaching user privacy. Titan also supports secure location sharing and navigation to protect user privacy with cryptographic technology.
        </p>
        <p>
         Hyperion has built three map layers — among which police station map and Embassy &amp; Consulates map is free to use. Global tourists (esp. overseas Chinese) can directly view the location details of police station and Embassy &amp; Consulates London, Hong Kong, Jakarta, San Francisco and Los Angeles when click on the layers; and global night life tourism map helps discover great fun in South East — for explorers pay to download. Map Store currently supports Google Pay, and will transfer to HYN payment when wallet is installed in Titan privacy map.
        </p>
        <p>
         <img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1380/0*fV2d8BzsfRtoRcd4.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
         More excitingly, Titan Map Store will add more layers with lots of fun in future. Imagine when you go out for hiking, you can load hiking routes layer for recommended spots and navigation; when you go out for dinner with limited budget, load discount food map to save time for restaurants-search, etc. Pervasive and personalized map data is the core competitiveness of decentralized map, you can select to view whatever layer in need on map. By comparison, centralized map platforms such as Google barely can achieve the feature, since they care too much about profits and too expensive. Map community members will influx more creative ideas to enrich the types of map layers for greater audience.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most block chains failed to attract sufficient participants to drive a healthy ecology since they did not find a rigid demand. Map Store hit the pain point of existing map industry, and will circulate data value through the Map Store. Contributors who serve data requests or build up map layers will receive economic rewards to sustain the mechanism. Based on Hyperion blockchain, developers will generate smart contracts to run applications such as Wechat, Ctrip, DiDi.

         Map3
        </h3>
        <p>
         Map3 is the first global decentralized service network that supports Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPs). Similar to bitcoin off-chain lightning network, Map3 distributes diversified global map data to business users with high efficiency through open-source service ecology based on decentralized map service protocol.
        </p>
        <p>
         Map3 adopts strong cryptographic primitive to support map data encryption, in order to secures user privacy from centralized third-party platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Map3 is composed of core and edge network. While core network offers reliable source of data, edge network distributes data effectively. Edge nodes are located in edge network, which can be joined via home computers and idle broadband resources. Currently users can deploy edge nodes via AWS (global users) and Aliyun (Chinese users). Core nodes are located in core network, which ensures highly trusted and secure source of data. In future, core nodes can distribute private or public map data, standardize data value, and gain profits in HYN.
        </p>
        <p>
         Map3 network offers basic map data for free. With increased data layer service and participation of business users, Map3 will charge value-added service. Thus, both node users and map layer contributors will earn profits on HYN deposits. Increased nodes extend the service scale with more efficiency and high-quality data service. HYN deposit also prevents infringement to the network.

         Titan
        </h3>
        <p>
         Titan is the first consumer-facing decentralized privacy map app based on cryptographic technology, as a demonstration of Map3 network., Titan offers map location search, share and navigation functions, similar to Google and Baidu map.
        </p>
        <p>
         Titan advantages in ultra-privacy protection through four features — cryptographic location share (use secure public key identity), encrypted navigation, burn-up history, and offline map.
        </p>
        <p>
         Users can access accurate location and navigation service and enjoy secure and efficient location service without having to provide personal information,
        </p>
        <p>
         Map data will be enriched as more contributors add map data layers. Diversified map data will be used in various scenarios, such as hiking, overseas navigation, and privation location exploration, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
         In future, Titan users will join Map3 network as edge nodes through federated learning, and earn profits on HYN deposits.

        <h3 id="atlas-chain">
         Atlas Chain
        </h3>
        <p>
         Atlas is a high-performance spatial consensus blockchain that supports world-scale map service based on Elastic Spatial Sharding. It aims to solve spatial service requirements such as map asset transactions and validation, with special features such as censorship resistance, open participation and fault-tolerance. Atlas will empower Hyperion to build decentralized global map economy that serves 10 billion users when built.
        </p>
        <p>
         Atlas will improve in scalability, low-latency, low-cost, privacy-preservation, extensibility, and interoperability when built, to satisfy the world-scale location requests. When MainNet launched, users will join Map3 as Atlas nodes to improve the security and performance of blockchain network, with economic rewards in HYN. Rewarding details is yet to be confirmed, but will be closely linked with edge and core nodes community.
        </p>
        <h3 id="vision-in-future">
         Vision in future
        </h3>
        <p>
         After the upgrade to Map3 2.0, Hyperion team is optimizing Map3 network and Titan privacy map, while exploring more practical and attractive map scenarios. We welcome more users to join decentralized map community and contribute through building map technology, and governing location information, while obtaining sustainable economic rewards.
        </p>
        <p>
         Main Net is expected to be launched in Dec 2019, by then nodes community will grow quickly to serve the world better and secure. We need your support to go further.

         Hyperion officially launched Map3 2.0 — the decentralized map service network that supports Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (Https). Map3 2.0 will activate massive edge nodes from decentralized map community to enable more efficient and secure map data service.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3 id="upgrade-of-map3-10">
         Upgrade of Map3 1.0
        </h3>
        <p>
         Map3 1.0 used HyperText Transfer Protocol (Http) and adopted strong cryptographic primitive to support map data encryption to protect the privacy of individual and business users from third party platforms. However, it fails to load map tiles using Https, which creates problems for map users. Although edge nodes can deal with map data requests through the nodes deployed by Hyperion, however individual nodes were not completely activated. The upgrade will solve this issue.
        </p>
        <p>
         The rule of data transaction differs between Http and Http. Any data you enter into the site (such as your username/password, credit card or bank details, any other form submission data, etc.) using Http will be sent plaintext and therefore exposed to interception or potential alteration. Therefore, Http is not secure to communicate sensitive and private information.
        </p>
        <h3 id="why-map3-20-values-to-map-community">
         Why Map3 2.0 values to map community
        </h3>
        <p>
         Https requires certificate from a trusted authority to ensure content trustiness and privacy, and keeps information encrypted in submission process. In other words, it protects privacy and is safe to use.
        </p>
        <p>
         Map3 2.0 is upgraded to support Https, aiming to offer secure and complete Map3 resources, and stimulate data traffic through activated edge nodes. The widespread Map3 2.0 nodes will improve the efficiency and quality of global map service, and benefit map community in terms of user experience and node service rewards. The deployment of edge nodes remains the same, either via AWS (global users), Aliyun (Chinese users), or NAS (docker). Hyperion will arrange the current edge node users to upgrade to Map3 2.0 within the community. We welcome users to leave us a message or post your inquiries in Hyperion Forum.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, edge nodes are able to provide data service without having to hold the certificate, mainly for security reasons. When encryption or certificate approval is required, edge nodes need to submit the request to upper nodes who hold the certificate. This is similar to bank service system. when a customer identity information needs approval at the counter, the customer service will submit the request to the branch manager who has the authority (certificate) to proceed the service. In other words, with activated edge nodes in the network, via HYN deposits in the network, node users will get more rewards with improved network service quality.
        </p>
        <p>
         When business customers join the network, on the one hand, they adopt the highly effective network capability to create their own data source with personalized domain name and certificate to distribute their map data. On the other hand, they obtain much cheaper, efficient and secure map data service than Google and Baidu. 2B users will help complete the circulation of Hyperion ecology through HYN deposits. In addition, HYN circulation can avoid evil behaviors in the network, to ensure the high-quality of data service.
        </p>
        <p>
         Hyperion Team dedicates to build up One Map solution for the World through decentralized technologies, and to provide a trusted and secure map data based on spatial consensus protocol based on its core value: aggressively open and decentralized. Everyone will be empowered to build map technology, share economic return and govern map communities when the decentralized world is built.

        <p>
         Hyperion officially launched a new feature of Titan — cryptographic navigation function, which is now available for global Android users. Titan navigation shares similar features with Google and Baidu Maps navigation; however, it is built based on Hyperion decentralized map database, which secures to offer accurate map data with the nature of privacy protection. In other words, users do not need to provide any personal information to explore hiking, cycling and driving routes.
        </p>
        <p>
         The convenient and “free” map services we use every day are on the cost of our privacy. For instance, the precise prediction of navigation services provided by centralized database such as Google or Baidu depend on people’s daily geographic information, and earn profits through data sales. In addition, data leakage is closely linked with our daily life. The advertisements promoted online everyday are based on our individual data retrieved by those platforms, which in turn influence our daily social, economic and political decisions without knowing. By contrast, Titan map offers a safe alternative to map users with the following designs: it utilizes GPS functionality to provide accurate location services without user information, and protects privacies through cryptographic technology. In addition, Titan has designed the “burn-up history” button, which allows users to delete location history remained on your device. With the development of Hyperion MapChain Ecology, every Titan user will join the dencentralized service network Map3 as an edge node to contribute to the network.
        </p>
        <p>
         Titan will keep upgrading the current navigation version, and add more services such as map styles and street view, which will integrate users with the landscape, landmarks on the map, and explore restaurants, hotels, infrastructure in small alleys and side lane with the best routes, while protects privacies. We welcome more Titan users to join us at Hyperion Forum to share your product experience and ideas to help us improve the product.

         In 1984, George Orwell depicted an oppressive society under hegemonic political control and pervasive telescreen which is always on. Wherever you go, you’ll be greeted on each landing by a poster underscored with the words “BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU.”
        </p>
        <p>
         Privacy, as our birthright, is under surveillance by Internet and technology platforms, who utilise big data to influence our daily decisions. Apple CEO Tim Cook has called for new digital privacy laws in the United States to regulate companies, warning the harmful consequences caused by the collection of huge amounts of personal data. Cook pointed out that modern technology has led to the creation of a “data-industrial complex” in which private and everyday information is “weaponized against us with military efficiency.” However, even Apple was targeted by the spyware product Exodus, which could access photos, videos, device IDs, audio recordings, and contacts on target devices, while even could track a victim’s location and listening to their conversations through the iPhone or iPad’s microphone Once installed.

         Privacy Trading
        </h3>
        <p>
         In the era of big data, individual privacy becomes trading capital for companies to make profits without proper regulations. 2018 privacy scandals exposed big techs’ profit model based on user data, and woke people to explore the privacy overuse and protections. In the meantime, those who lack the motivations to figure out privacy matters, believing the cost of personal data will reward them with better service and cheaper products, will soon realize even the big techs are changing towards privacy strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let’s take Google as an example. Google’s ecosystem is performed under its parent company, Alphabet, which has annual revenues of over $100 billion from digital ads. Alphabet helps Google collect user data from the Google Display Network — containing over 2 million sites and reaching over 90% of Internet users. Although Google was fined $57 million by GDPR for user privacy misconduct, the fine only accounted for 0.0045% of its annual gross profit. If Google becomes a bad choice, what alternatives do we have?

         Time and space elements explain basic human behaviors. For instance, the evidence of an alibi that judges whether a person was at the crime scene can be proved by time and geographic information. Even spatial data is enough to predict a person’s identity. For instance, by tracking a person’s home location and daily commute trace, a platform can accurately predict who that person is.

        <p>
         Hyperion launched a privacy map — Titan, aiming to provide 100% privacy map service. I will share my detailed product experience with all map users as follows.
        </p>
        <p>
         #Registration details required
        </p>
        <p>
         In most cases, users are required to fill in personal details when registering a new account. While Titan does not. It will ask me whether to participate product improvement plan when opened. If permits, as explained in the policy, Titan will collect device data only, such as the phone model. By contrast, Google Map integrates user accounts with personal details across all platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
         #Burn up history
The “burn history” function is easy-to-discover at the front page. The button is a Titan logo, which will clear all my trace on the map with one tap. An easy design will remind users to use the function. Google’s delete history button is tricky, which requires users to find guidelines in help centre, go to timeline, and tap settings to delete all location history. If the valuable location history data remains, Google will allow 2 million sites within the network to access it.
        </p>
        <p>
         #Offline map
        </p>
        <p>
         It is estimated that an idle Android phone with Chrome active in the background sends location information to Google 340 times during a 24-hour period, including users’ name, telephone no., birthday, credit card no., as well as location data. Turn off mobile phone or Google app does not stop the data transmission. While Titan offers the option to use downloaded map data without internet and data connections.
        </p>
        <p>
         #Private location share
        </p>
        <p>
         Cryptographic location share is easy to understand. Titan encrypts both the location and receiver address, to make sure the only address holder can decrypt the map code received. Some might worry if decrypted map will be leaked out by screenshots. But it just doesn’t work like that. First the privacy Titan protects contains both the recognizable personal ID from the sender and receiver, as well as the location details. However, the decrypted map generated on Titan does not include any ID information, whereby disables the risk of privacy leakage from screenshots.
        </p>
        <h3 id="who-will-need-privacy-map">
         Who Will Need Privacy Map?
        </h3>
        <p>
         According to a survey conducted by China Youth Daily, more than 60% of respondents using mobile apps allowed their personal information to be shared with third parties. The situation is changing. Accenture Strategy presented in &lt;2017 Global Consumer Pulse Research&gt; that more than half of Chinese consumers now concern about personal data security when using AI service products. A random survey conducted by the end of 2018 by privacy browser Duckduckgo discovered that 1/3 of adults have set “Do not track me” on browser settings.
        </p>
        <p>
         From my point of view, “security” is the valuable key to trigger potential privacy map user growth. The security Titan provides belongs to civil society, which is outside the regulation of governments. In other words, privacy map allows secure civil map location share without authority’s surveillance, such as between public figures, marginalized groups, or any personalized consumption behaviors needs. With the above features, Titan has already differentiated itself from the existing map service we use. After all, the widespread of privacy map, as I believe, requires sticky consumers, diversified scenarios for privacy location share; and a healthy ecosystem that rewards communities.
