           Making full use of Cubiex services requires your registration as a user. For registration purposes, you only need to create a user name and leave your eMail address. Furthermore, for security purposes, you have to enter a password that will, at a later stage, allow you to log-in to Cubiex. Once you have finished registration by accepting the Cubiex User Agreement, we will send you an automatic eMail to the address provided during the registration procedure. This eMail will contain a link you will have to click in order to finalize your registration. We haven built this procedure to make sure that only the actual holder of an eMail account may create a profile on Cubiex connected with such eMail account. These processing activities are required in the context of forming an agreement between you and Cubiex and, therefore, legitimized under Art. 6 (1), sentence 1, lit. b of the GDPR. Furthermore, we have a legitimate interest to make the registration procedure as secure as possible, whereas the processing of your personal data is also covered by Art. 6 (1), sentence 1, lit. f of the GDPR.

           Once you are registered, you may log-in to Cubiex and create your account (profile). You may then also provide us and other users with further information about you, e.g. tell other people where you live, how experienced you are in certain games, what you are looking for in the network. Which further information you share is entirely up to you. You may also at any time delete information from your profile which will then not be displayed any longer to other users. Thus, any processing of further information will solely be based on your freely given consent, Art. 6 (1), sentence 1, lit. a of the GDPR. However, the more information you share, the easier it will be for other users to connect with you through the search engine on Cubiex. If you do not share any further personal data, the only information on you provided to other users would be your user name.

           Cubiex offers you a variety of tools to interact with other users of the platform, including audiocalls, videocalls, text chats, and file transfer options. Which information you share with other users through these tools, is entirely up to you. Also, any information you share via these tools will remain between you and the other user(s) you include in the communication. We will, however, provide the necessary technique to allow user communication, and we will also store your text chats on our server so that you can follow up on a chat at a later stage. But we will not in any way make use of the contents of such inter-user communication. You may also at any time delete information from chats which will then not be displayed any longer to other users. Any processing in this respect will, thus, solely be based on your freely given consent, Art. 6 (1), sentence 1, lit. a of the GDPR.
