You need to work smart and understand what happens to that resume once you apply for that job to truly put yourself in the driving seat and make your resume stand out to a hiring manager.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNew figures show that when a hiring manager is viewing resumes they more or less scan for around 6 seconds to decipher if you are suitable or not. But let's not forget that you need to get to that stage first. Many applications will not even get to the hiring manager and below we will tell you why.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"the-journey-your-resume-takes-after-you-apply\"\u003eThe journey your resume takes after you apply?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s what happens to your resume once you apply to that dream job:\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eMost times your resume will be uploaded into an ATS (Applicant Tracking System) that the company that is hiring uses to manage the hiring process and filter applications.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe ATS will then parse your resume and look for key criteria and for specific keywords that the hirer would find beneficial.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf you don't have the skills that match, have a complicated resume, not in the format that the ATS can read then you are out of luck. While your resume might be a \"great read\" the ATS may think you are not suitable. Your resume will just stay in the system and your resume will not even get into the hiring pile.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf your resume does pass the initial ATS test you will be added to the list of applicants to review, the ATS will add these to be reviewed by a human hiring manager.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt is possible that the Hiring manger now has 50 resumes to review. They all look the same and this is where you need to grab someones attention.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRemember at this stage you have around 6 seconds to impress so tailor you resume to have the right keywords to match the job description but also to put yourself in the hirer's shoes.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"your-foot-in-the-door\"\u003eYour foot in the door\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne tip is to analyse what a resume is for?

Don't match your resume exactly to your Linkedin profile. they will probably check your profile and will want to see some originality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTailor each application and resume to the job description itself as this will definitely help getting your resume to the top of the ATS pile.\u003c/p\u003e","comment_id":"5df36f23ebe9997d49555363","feature_image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/webassets.job.com/blog/2019/12/shutterstock_1218770899.jpg","featured":false,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":"2019-12-13T10:59:47.000+00:00","updated_at":"2019-12-13T11:21:00.000+00:00","published_at":"2019-12-13T11:21:00.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":"So you are looking for a job - you write a long list of items you want to include in your resume and then once you have that together you apply for lots of jobs.
