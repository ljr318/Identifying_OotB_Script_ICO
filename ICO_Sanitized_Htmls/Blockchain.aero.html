          NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE CONTRIBUTORS
         </p>
         <p>
          Kindly be aware that this website and the White Paper have not been registered as a prospectus or offering memorandum with any financial services authorities of any country under the legislation covering issues related to securities and financial instruments due to general understanding that, to the best of knowledge and belief that is shared among the McFly Community, this is neither an offering of securities, nor of financial instruments, nor of any other kind of investor participation in future income by the efforts of others, nor a common enterprise. McFly Community and Blockchain.aero Alliance is an international initiative welcoming participants from every country of the world for the cause of building the future of affordable city flights for everybody. The Community and Alliance are unable to follow constant changes and updates to rules and regulations relating to cryptocurrency and crypto tokens in every country and do not intend to do so. Every participant shall and obliges to consider and where appropriate obtain legal advice in each respective country as to whether he/she is in compliance with respective country’s legislation when deciding to take part in the Token Launch, contribute to the development of McFly Community or join Blockchain.aero Alliance.

          KYC and AML
         </p>
         <p>
          We cannot have KYC (know-your-client) procedure as you are not our clients: everybody who is ready to develop Blockchain.aero system, and McFLY tokens with it, is a community member who came here to build a definite project within the infrastructure that is now to be born out of our communal labour.
         </p>
         <p>
          At this, we must arrange procedures which can decrease the risks to you and and to all of us as the developing community in our operation in fiat world. As we see it, one of the means to do so is to make a call for the community IDs.
         </p>
         <p>
          Our Community is not going to be the controlling party for financial or (anti-money laundering/ currency/exchange/money transfer) whatever control, as these issues are successfully controlled by state authorities. We, as a Community, do not want, and must not, become an authority agent to help your government impose any limitations on you; nevertheless we urge you to be aware that our area is very high-risk, can often be associated with “schemes”, and in every jurisdiction it will take us additional efforts to demonstrate our transparency, integrity, bona-fide and clear intentions. For the sake of functionality of the Community and the Alliance, so that our common cause would not be infringed by the incompetent regulator’s ruling or stray initiatives, we suggest to collect our Community members’ identification info.
         </p>
         <p>
          For this, we ask you to kindly share this kind of information about you:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           copies of 2 proofs of ID (for instance, a copy of your passport (with photo) plus a driving licence)
          </li>
          <li>
           a copy of your Utility Bill as a proof of residence;
          </li>
          <li>
           some words about your education and occupation, to let the community members call on you for the matters covered by your professional experience; a link to your LinkedIn or FB profile will also be very welcome here;
          </li>
          <li>
           your contact details to enable the community members contact you when needed for the matters concerning projects enabling Blockchain.aero deployment in every city.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          The information provided to us will be stored with an independent law office, and shall not be disclosed to any person without a formal request from any government body, court, or international investigating agency.
         </p>
         <p>
          On the basis of this information other community members (a law firm) will make a register briefly describing your areas of interest and expertise. Then for any request from a community member relating to your area, our community moderator (and no one other) will contact you, and discuss with you possibilities of your further involvement and cooperation.
         </p>
         <p>
          We are very pro personal data protection and privacy. But we also have an immense business and community idea to bring to reality, and that makes us accept certain obligations to create a low-risk documental environment for all of the involved ones and to ensure that our common cause remains protected. That is why we have to warn you, that, if you decide not to provide your ID information for the Community, we reserve the right to refuse your tokens and refund your contributions.

           WARNING: TRANSACTIONS WITH TOKENS MAY REPRESENT BREACH OF LAW IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          Kindly be aware that this website and the White Paper have not been registered as a prospectus or offering memorandum with any financial services authorities of any country under the legislation covering issues related to securities and financial instruments due to the general understanding that, to the best of knowledge and belief that is shared among the McFly Community, this is neither an offering of securities, nor of financial instruments, nor of any other kind of investor participation in future income by the efforts of others, nor a common enterprise.

         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           WARNING: DO NOT ACQUIRE OR IN ANY OTHER WAY OBTAIN McFLY IF YOU ARE NOT AN EXPERT IN DEALING WITH CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS AND BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SOFTWARE SYSTEMS
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          Ownership, acquisition or in any other way obtaining McFLY should be undertaken only by individuals, entities, or companies that have significant experience with, and understanding of, the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens, like bitcoin (“BTC”), ethereum (“ETH”) and Waves (“WAVES”), and blockchainbased software systems. You must have functional understanding of storage and transmission mechanisms associated with other cryptographic tokens. If you do not have such experience or expertise, then you should not attempt to acquire or in any other way obtain McFLY or participate in the McFLY token launch.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           WARNING: CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS MAY EXPERIENCE EXTREME PRICE VOLATILITY
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          Blockchain.Aero Alliance tokens do not represent any formal or legally binding investment. The value of McFLY which may be denominated in BTC or in any other denominator of value in various jurisdictions, may be subject to extreme fluctuations in price over short periods of time on a regular basis. Blockchain.Aero cannot and does not guarantee market liquidity for McFLY. Additionally, due to di erent regulatory dictates in di erent jurisdictions and the inability of citizens of certain countries to use service providers located anywhere in the world, the liquidity of McFLY may be markedly di erent in di erent countries. By acquiring McFLY, you expressly acknowledge and represent that you fully understand that McFLY may experience volatility in value and will not seek to hold any of the Blockchain.Aero Alliance parties liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising from, or in any way connected to, the Token Launch and any subsequent sale, acquisition or ownership of McFLY.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           WARNING: THE ACQUISITION AND OWNERSHIP OF McFLY ENTAILS A NUMBER OF RISKS
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          The acquisition or in any other way obtaining McFLY carries with it a number of risks. Prior to acquiring or in any other way obtaining McFLY, you should carefully consider the risks listed below and, to the extent necessary, consult an appropriate lawyer, accountant, or tax professional. By owning McFLY you are agreeing not to hold any of the Blockchain.Aero participants liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising from, or in any way connected, to the acquisition or ownership of McFLY.
         </p>
         <p>
          The ownership, acquisition, purchase or obtaining in any other way of McFLY carries with it significant risk. Prior to making any actions or considerations regarding the McFLY, you should carefully consider the below risks and, to the extent necessary, consult a lawyer, accountant, and/or tax professionals.
         </p>
         <p>
          <em>
           A.
          </em>
          It is possible that the value of BTC will drop significantly in future, depriving Blockchain.Aero Alliance of sufficient resources to continue to operate.
         </p>
         <p>
          <em>
           B.
          </em>
          McFLY will be stored in a wallet, which can only be accessed with a password selected by you. If you do not maintain an accurate record of your password, this may lead to the loss of McFLY. You must safely store your password in one or more backup locations that are well separated from the primary location. In order to access your McFLY the password that you had entered is required; loss of this may lead to the loss of your McFLY.
         </p>
         <p>
          <em>
           C.
          </em>
          Any third party that gains access to your Email may be able to gain access to your McFLY. You must take care not to respond to any inquiry regarding your ownership of McFLY, including but not limited to, email requests purportedly coming from the
          <a href="http://blockchain.aero/">
           http://blockchain.aero

          website or
          <a href="http://wavesplatform.com/">

          or a similar-looking domain.

         <p>
          <em>
           D.
          </em>
          Cryptocurrencies have been the subject of regulatory scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the globe. Blockchain.Aero could be impacted by one or more regulatory enquiries or regulatory action, which could impede or limit the ability of Blockchain.Aero to continue to develop the Blockchain.Aero projects.
         </p>
         <p>
          <em>
           E.
          </em>
          It is possible that the Blockchain.Aero products will not be used by a large number of external businesses, individuals, and other organizations and that there will be limited public interest in the use of McFLY Tokens for aerial vehicles operation. Such a lack of interest could impact the development of the Blockchain.Aero projects. Blockchain.Aero Alliance cannot predict the success of its own marketing efforts or the efforts of other third parties. There is no guarantee of revenues or profits resulting from the marketing activities of the Blockchain.Aero.
         </p>
         <p>
          <em>
           F.
          </em>
          You recognise that the Blockchain. Aero, the Alliance and its projects are currently under development and may undergo significant changes. You acknowledge that any expectations regarding the form and functionality of the Blockchain.Aero Alliance projects may not be met upon release of any one of the Blockchain.Aero Alliance projects, for any number of reasons including a change in the design and implementation plans and execution of the implementation of the Blockchain.Aero Alliance projects.
         </p>
         <p>
          <em>
           G.
          </em>
          You understands that while the Blockchain.Aero, the Alliance and its projects will make reasonable efforts to complete the related products, it is possible that completed versions of the products may not be released and projects may never be accomplished.
         </p>
         <p>
          <em>
           H.
          </em>
          Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to steal the tokens from Token Launch, thus potentially impacting the ability of Blockchain.Aero Alliance to promote the Blockchain.Aero Alliance projects.
         </p>
         <p>
          <em>
           I.
          </em>

          The loss or destruction of a private keys used to access the blockchain by the Blockchain.Aero Alliance may be irreversible.

          Decentralized mass passenger urban aviation is a new product, thus contributing to price volatility that could adversely affect the usability of McFLY. The factors affecting the further development of the digital tokens industry, as well as the Blockchain.Aero Alliance projects, include:
         </p>
         <p>
          I. continued worldwide growth in the adoption and use of McFLY and other digital tokens;
         </p>
         <p>
          II. government and quasi-government regulation of McFLY and other digital tokens and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of the Blockchain.Aero Alliance projects or similar digital token systems;
         </p>
         <p>
          III. the maintenance and development of the software of the Blockchain.Aero Alliance projects;

          IV. changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;

          Third parties may assert intellectual property claims relating to the holding and transfer of digital tokens, technologies and their source code. Regardless of the merit of any intellectual property or other legal action, any threatened action that reduces confidence in the Blockchain. Aero Alliance projects’ long-term viability or the ability of end-users to hold and transfer McFLY may adversely affect the usability of McFLY.

         <p>
          <em>
           N.
          </em>
          Cryptocurrency exchanges on which McFLY may be listed in future are relatively new and largely unregulated and may therefore be more exposed to fraud and failure than established, regulated exchanges for other products. Such cryptocurrency exchange failures may result in a reduction in the usability and can adversely affect the McFLY. A lack of stability in the cryptocurrency exchanges and the closure or temporary shutdown of cryptocurrency exchanges due to fraud, business failure, hackers or malware, or government- mandated regulation may reduce confidence in the Blockchain. Aero Alliance projects and their products result in greater volatility in perceived value of the McFLY and its usability.

          </em>
          Political or economic crises may motivate large-scale sales of McFLY, which could result in a reduction in the perceived value and adversely affect the value and usability of McFLY. Digital tokens such as McFLY, which are relatively new, are subject to supply and demand forces based upon the desirability of an alternative, decentralized means of transacting, and it is unclear how such supply and demand will be impacted by geopolitical events.

         <p>
          <em>
           P.
          </em>
          Larger and larger scale usage of McFLY, growth of the blockchain.aero Alliance and adoption of its products shall result in a reduction in its price making flight more and more affordable, reducing its price.

         <p>
          <em>
           Q.
          </em>
          It is possible that a digital token other than McFLY could have features that make it more desirable to a material portion of the digital token user base, resulting in a reduction in demand for McFLY, which could have a negative impact on the usage, value, price of McFLY. It is possible that a comparable product could become materially popular due to either a perceived or exposed shortcoming of the relevant Blockchain.Aero Alliance product that is not immediately addressed by the Blockchain.Aero Alliance, or a perceived advantage of a comparable product that includes features not incorporated into the relevant Blockchain.Aero Alliance product. If this product obtains significant market share, it could have a negative impact on the demand for, and price of, and the usability of the McFLY.

          <em>
           R.
          </em>
          McFLY transactions are irrevocable and stolen McFLY or incorrectly transferred McFLY shall most likely be irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly executed McFLY transactions could adversely affect the value of McFLY. Cryptocurrency transactions are not, from an administrative perspective, reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the transaction or, in theory, control or consent of a majority of the processing power on the host blockchain platform. Once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the blockchain, an incorrect transfer of McFLY or a theft of McFLY generally will not be reversible and there shall be no compensation for any such transfer or theft. Such loss could adversely affect the value and usability of McFLY.

           S.
          </em>
          In the foreseeable future some McFLY tokens may be issued on the Ethereum or other blockchain. As such, any malfunction or unexpected functioning of the Ethereum or any such other protocol may impact your ability to transfer or securely hold McFLY. Such impact could adversely affect the value and usability of McFLY.

     TOKEN LAUNCH PHASE 1.2. DUE TO MARKET VOLATILITY IS RESCHEDULED TO START ON THE 5TH OF APRIL 2018

     <p>
      You have seen the current crypto rates and the news. The consensus view is that things will clear up in Spring. Moreover Blockchain.aero Alliance members will have so much more out of labs by then making McFly.aero case even stronger. Therefore the Token Launch Phase 1.2 is rescheduled to start on the 5th of April 2018 — exactly the middle of Spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      This affects the expected time when those who hold McFLY tokens on Waves Platform (including most of the core community) will be able to swap 1:1 into ERC20-type McFLY tokens on the Ethereum platform. This will only become technically possible once the TLP 1.2 is over.
     </p>
     <p>
      Taking this opportunity to share news, Keith Teare (known to many as a co-founder of TechCrunch) is our advisor now, but shhhh, we will make a more formal introduction within shortly. Stay tuned, many more developments await!

     McFLY Tokens on various platforms
    </div>
    <div class="text" style="height: 627.6px;">
     <p>
      Blockchain.aero Consortium is committed to developing the best suited blockchain solution for the air taxi management system. Various protocols may be tested, there may also be a bundle of blockchains servicing various aspects of the integral use scenario. Several Blockchain providers and developers already take part in the Consortium. McFLY Tokens issued within any of the systems are fully fungible 1:1 and their number will not exceed the total cap for the Token Launch Program.
     </p>
     <p>
      Here is the OFFICIAL list of McFLY tokens:
      <br/>
      - Waves Platform McFLY token ID:
      <span class="modal__word-break">
       <strong>
        7EHVUjcgEV9Du8qp95tS1eBV8DFtenmX64H3QawdCkC4
       </strong>
      </span>
      <br/>
      - Ethereum ERC-20 McFLY token ID:
      <span class="modal__word-break">
       <strong>
        0x17e2c574cf092950ef89fb4939c97db2086e796f
       </strong>
      </span>
      <br/>
      (more are expected)
     </p>
     <p>
      McFLY tokens issued on WavesPlatform in July 2017 are fully supported and valid. They may be swapped into ERC20 (Ethereum) McFLY tokens (or further tokens issued on Universa, et al.) as the case develops, and the rate is always 1:1.
     </p>
     <p>
      Illustration of how that will work: For McFLY-on-Waves holders — you send your Waves-based McFLY Tokens to the issuer's address on the Waves Platform — 3PHzVtgakKM57U81theAcvbwKfQQBaLswj3 — and insert your ETH wallet address in the attachment field of the transaction input. You will get one ERC20-type McFLY on the attached ETH address, for every Waves-type McFLY that you send. Please refer to the
      <a href="/waves_manual.pdf" target="_blank">
       instruction manual
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      There is a reserve of ERC20 McFLY tokens to fully cover the circulating Waves-based McFLY, so no worries here. Excess McFLY tokens on Waves will be destroyed — no double accounting.
     </p>
     <p>
      Same principles will apply for McFLY tokens on other platforms like Universa or Emercoin. There will be no more than 1800 million McFLY after this Token Launch Phase.
