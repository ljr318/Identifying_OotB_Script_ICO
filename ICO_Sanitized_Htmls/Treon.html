        Business Model: The Future of Utility Payment Experience
       </h2>
       <p class="sub-text">
        Treon’s business model is based on multiple revenue streams coming from different utility services, mainly from distribution margins, transaction fees and platform usage fees. Treon (TXO) will realise healthy margins while delivering significant savings to utility providers.
       </p>
       <p class="sub-text">
        Treon gives back rewards to customers against using TXO tokens to make adoption and usage much more appealing. Additionally, such savings will be the catalyst for utility companies to move their cross - trade contracts to the blockchain in order to cost-effectively manage their business dealings.
       </p>
       <p class="sub-text">
        Through the consolidation of the above margins and fees, Treon business model is built to address a growing global market and be a true partner to utility providers, bringing real value to consumers and providers alike.

        <h3>
         Opportunities in Telecom
        </h3>
        <div class="detail">
         <p>
          Telecom utilities are at a more advanced stage in offering consumers digital solutions to enhance their experience. Treon will target telecom companies first to be the early adopters of the token and digital tool. According to GSMA, 2018 global telecom revenues from consumers are projected at USD 1.05 trillion, out of which USD 105 billion are revenues from online channels, i.e., online sales of top-ups and recharges.
         </p>
         <p>
          Telecom operators’ revenues will reach USD 1.1 trillion annually by 2019 (as per GSMA report). Almost 80% of the revenues are generated from selling airtime while 20% are revenues from interconnect and roaming services.
         </p>
         <p>
          Today, 10% of consumer revenues come from online payment channels (through websites or mobile apps), while 90% come from traditional physical payment channels. Online telecom revenues are evidently growing at an increasing rate. Treon (TXO) is targeting online telecom revenues to penetrate, expand, and acquire its fair share. With a conservative forecast of reaching a market share of 1.5% of online telecom airtime revenues, Treon (TXO) aims to capture up to USD 1.26 Billion worth of transactions on its platform by the end of 2023.
         </p>
         <p>
          Additionally, Treon (TXO) aims to digitise the industry’s interconnect and roaming agreements and migrate them to smart contracts on the Blockchain. The annual volume of business-to- business (B2B) interoperability agreements amounted in 2017 to USD 200 billion, as per GSMA. Treon (TXO) aspires to acquire 1.5% market share of these transactions and witness up to USD 420 Million worth of transactions on its platform by the end of 2023.

         Opportunities in Electricity and Water
        </h3>
        <div class="detail">
         <p>
          In 2017, electricity generated around USD 2.0 trillion of revenues, out of which USD 650 billion came from household consumers (business to consumer market). Our vision is to grab a considerable share of the online payment of household consumption through Treon’s Utilities Wallet and TXO token.
         </p>
         <p>
          Like telecom utilities, electricity companies sign agreements amongst similar providers to split revenues generated from shared infrastructure and networks. These business-to- business revenues are estimated to reach around USD 1.87 trillion. Treon (TXO) aims to grasp a large share of the ‘Digital Interoperability Agreements’ for the electricity sector through its blockchain smart contracts.
         </p>
         <p>
          Water utilities, on the other hand, generated USD 140 billion in 2017 from household consumption only. Treon (TXO) is determined to secure a significant market share of the ’Digital Payments for Water Utilities’ through its Utility Wallet using TXO tokens.
         </p>
         <p>
          Additionally, Treon is aiming to grasp a fair share of revenues resulting from digitising interoperability agreements on the blockchain with estimated transactions on the Treon platform reaching up to USD 2.6 billion.

         Opportunities in Natural Gas
        </h3>
        <div class="detail">
         <p class="wt-text">
          Natural gas utilities generated USD 350 billion from consumers’ usage in 2017. Treon’s business-to-consumer vision is to capture a considerable share of ’Digital Payment for Gas Utilities’ bull market through its Utilities Wallet and TXO tokens. The total consumer market is expected to soar up to USD 437 billion by 2023.
         </p>
         <p class="wt-text">
          Like telecom and electric utilities, natural gas companies sign wheeling and distribution agreements amongst similar providers to share revenues generated from shared infrastructure and networks. The estimated transactions volume amongst utilities via cross-trade agreements are estimated to reach USD 1.75 trillion by 2023. Treon (TXO) is poised to capture a considerable market share of the revenues resulting from digitising the Interoperability Agreements’ for the energy sector through its blockchain smart contracts.

        I’ve been in the renewable energy industry since its early days. Utility companies and their ecosystem partners have a real challenge in managing their cross-trade agreements, specifically Power Purchase Agreements and Wheeling Contracts. These agreements are mostly managed manually by each party, resulting in increased overhead costs and extended periods for revenue realization. I truly believe Treon's solution and business model have cracked this legacy problem. By applying the power of blockchain, technology utilities will be able to digitally manage and settle their cross-trade agreements faster with unprecedented transparency using TXO tokens and Treon's Smart Contracts Engine. Seeing the expected big potential, OneraSystems has been in strategic discussions with Treon to partner and collaborate on go-to-market solutions for the African and Asian markets in the near future.

        Opportunities in Telecom
       </h4>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
       <p>
        Telecom utilities are at a more advanced stage in offering consumers digital solutions to enhance their experience. Treon will target telecom companies first to be the early adopters of the token and digital tool. According to GSMA, 2018 global telecom revenues from consumers are projected at USD 1.05 trillion, out of which USD 105 billion are revenues from online channels, i.e., online sales of top-ups and recharges.
       </p>
       <p>
        Telecom operators’ revenues will reach USD 1.1 trillion annually by 2019 (as per GSMA report). Almost 80% of the revenues are generated from selling airtime while 20% are revenues from interconnect and roaming services.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, 10% of consumer revenues come from online payment channels (through websites or mobile apps), while 90% come from traditional physical payment channels. Online telecom revenues are evidently growing at an increasing rate. Treon (TXO) is targeting online telecom revenues to penetrate, expand, and acquire its fair share. With a conservative forecast of reaching a market share of 1.5% of online telecom airtime revenues, Treon (TXO) aims to capture up to USD 1.26 Billion worth of transactions on its platform by the end of 2023.
       </p>
       <p>
        Additionally, Treon (TXO) aims to digitise the industry’s interconnect and roaming agreements and migrate them to smart contracts on the Blockchain. The annual volume of business-to- business (B2B) interoperability agreements amounted in 2017 to USD 200 billion, as per GSMA. Treon (TXO) aspires to acquire 1.5% market share of these transactions and witness up to USD 420 Million worth of transactions on its platform by the end of 2023.

        Opportunities in Electricity and Water
       </h4>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
       <p>
        In 2017, electricity generated around USD 2.0 trillion of revenues, out of which USD 650 billion came from household consumers (business to consumer market). Our vision is to grab a considerable share of the online payment of household consumption through Treon’s Utilities Wallet and TXO token.
       </p>
       <p>
        Like telecom utilities, electricity companies sign agreements amongst similar providers to split revenues generated from shared infrastructure and networks. These business-to- business revenues are estimated to reach around USD 1.87 trillion. Treon (TXO) aims to grasp a large share of the ‘Digital Interoperability Agreements’ for the electricity sector through its blockchain smart contracts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Water utilities, on the other hand, generated USD 140 billion in 2017 from household consumption only. Treon (TXO) is determined to secure a significant market share of the ’Digital Payments for Water Utilities’ through its Utility Wallet using TXO tokens.
       </p>
       <p>
        Additionally, Treon is aiming to grasp a fair share of revenues resulting from digitising interoperability agreements on the blockchain with estimated transactions on the Treon platform reaching up to USD 2.6 billion.

        Opportunities in Natural Gas
       </h4>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
       <p>
        Natural gas utilities generated USD 350 billion from consumers’ usage in 2017. Treon’s business-to-consumer vision is to capture a considerable share of ’Digital Payment for Gas Utilities’ bull market through its Utilities Wallet and TXO tokens. The total consumer market is expected to soar up to USD 437 billion by 2023.
       </p>
       <p>
        Like telecom and electric utilities, natural gas companies sign wheeling and distribution agreements amongst similar providers to share revenues generated from shared infrastructure and networks. The estimated transactions volume amongst utilities via cross-trade agreements are estimated to reach USD 1.75 trillion by 2023. Treon (TXO) is poised to capture a considerable market share of the revenues resulting from digitising the Interoperability Agreements’ for the energy sector through its blockchain smart contracts.
