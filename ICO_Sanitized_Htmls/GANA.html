                        loss of Coins, and liability to the Company and others for its acts and omissions,
                        including without limitation those constituting breach of this Agreement,
                        negligence, fraud or willful misconduct. Buyer has obtained sufficient information
                        in order to make an informed decision to purchase the Coins.
        <br/>
        e) Restricted Country. Buyer is not a citizen, resident (tax or otherwise),
                        domiciliary and/or green card holder or other similar certificate of residency of a country

                        or other similar activities, or (B) where it is likely that the sale of Coins would be construed
                        as the sale of a security (howsoever named) or investment product
                        (including without limitation the United States of America, Singapore, People's Republic of China,
                        Hong Kong, Macau, Bolivia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Morocco, Namibia, Nepal, Pakistan,
                        Ecuador, Myanmar, Aibor Coast, Cuba, Iran, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and Syria) (each a “Restricted Country”),
                        nor are you purchasing Coins from any Restricted Country, nor are you an entity
                        (including but not limited to any corporation or partnership) incorporated, established or registered in

                        from a Restricted Country.
        <br/>
        f) Funds; Payments. The funds, including any fiat, virtual currency or
                        cryptocurrency, Buyer uses to purchase Coins are not derived from or related to

                        financing.
        <br/>
        g) No Investment. Buyer is not purchasing Coins for investment purposes.
        <br/>
        2. No Company Representations or Warranties.
        <br/>
        a) COMPANY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND
                        WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY.
        <br/>
        b) WITH RESPECT TO THE COINS, THEIR UTILITY AND THE ABILITY OF

                        CODING THEREOF, OR THE ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN,
                        WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT.
        <br/>
        c) COMPANY DISCLAIM ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
                        THAT THE PROCESS OF PURCHASING OR RECEIVING THE COINS WILL
                        BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT THE COINS ARE
                        RELIABLE OR ERROR-FREE.

        <b>
         4. BUYER ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS OF RISKS
        </b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Buyer has carefully reviewed, acknowledges, understands and assumes the following risks, as
                        well as all other risks associated with the Coins (including those not discussed herein), all of
                        which could render the Coins worthless or of little value:
        <br/>
        1. Basis for Purchase. Purchasing Coins is at Buyer’s sole risk and that the Coins are
                        each provided, used and acquired on an “AS IS” and on an “AS AVAILABLE” basis
                        without representations, warranties, promises or guarantees whatsoever of any kind by
                        Company. Buyer must rely on its own examination and investigation thereof.
        <br/>
        2. No Rights, Functionality or Features. Coins have no rights, uses, purpose,
                        attributes, functionalities or features, express or implied, outside the Project.
        <br/>
        3. Project. Coins may not be usable on the Project and do not entitle Buyer to
                        anything with respect to the Project.
        <br/>
        4. Purchase Price Risk. There are no guarantees as to the price of Coins purchased
                        by Buyer and no guarantees that the price per Coin determined by the market will be equal
                        to or higher. There is the possibility that the price per Coin may fall below the price paid by
                        initial buyers of Tokens during the initial distribution period.
        <br/>
        5. Blockchain Delay Risk. On the Ethereum Blockchain Protocol, transactions may
                        not be recorded in the last-closed ledger until the transaction has been ratified through the
                        Ethereum consensus algorithm. Timing of ratification may occur at random times.
        <br/>
        6. Ethereum Consensus Ledger. Transactions on the Ethereum Consensus Ledger
                        may be delayed or lost due to operational error or malicious attacks by third parties. Buyer
                        acknowledges and understands that the last-closed ledger may not include Buyer’s
                        transaction when Buyer wants or expects and that Buyer’s transaction may be excluded or
                        discarded entirely.
        <br/>
        7. Ability to Transact or Resell. Buyer may be unable to sell or otherwise transact in
                        Coins at any time, or for the price Buyer paid due to (a) diminution in value of the Coins;
                        (b) lack of liquidity for the Coins; or (c) Company imposing restrictions on the
                        transferability of the Coins.
        <br/>
        8. Coin Security. Coins may be subject to expropriation and or/theft. Hackers or
                        other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Coins in a variety
                        of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-
                        based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, because the Ethereum
                        Blockchain Protocol rests on open source software and Coins are based on open source
                        software, there is the risk that such software may contain intentional or unintentional bugs
                        or weaknesses which may negatively affect the Coins or result in the loss of Buyer’s Coins,
                        the loss of Buyer’s ability to access or control Buyer’s Coins or the loss of any other assets
                        in Buyer’s account. In the event of such a software bug or weakness, there may be no
                        remedy and holders of Coins are not guaranteed any remedy, refund or compensation.
        <br/>
        9. Access to Private Keys. Coins purchased by Buyer may be held by Buyer in
                        Buyer’s digital wallet or vault, which requires a private key, or a combination of private
                        keys, for access. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with Buyer’s
                        digital wallet or vault storing Coins may result in loss of such Coins, access to Buyer’s Coin
                        balance or any balances in blockchains created by third parties. Moreover, any third party
                        that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a
                        hosted wallet or vault service Buyer uses, may be able to misappropriate Buyer’s Coins.
                        Company is not responsible for any such losses.
        <br/>
        10. New Technology. The Project and all of the matters set forth in the White Paper
                        are new and untested. The Project might not be capable of completion, implementation or
                        adoption. Even if the Project is completed, implemented and adopted, it might not function
                        as intended, and any tokens associated with a blockchain adopting the Project may not have
                        functionality that is desirable or valuable. Also, technology is changing rapidly, so the
                        Coins and the Project may become outdated.
        <br/>
        11. Tax Consequences. The purchase and receipt of Coins may have tax consequences
                        for Buyer. Buyer is solely responsible for Buyer’s compliance with Buyer’s tax obligations.
        <br/>
        12. Failure to Map a Public Key to Buyer’s Account. Failure of Buyer to map a public
                        key to Buyer’s account may result in third parties being unable to recognize Buyer’s Coin
                        balance on the Ethereum Consensus Ledger.
        <br/>
        13. Changes to the Project. The Project is still under development and may undergo
                        significant changes over time. Company may make changes to such features and
                        specifications for any number of reasons, any of which may mean that the Project does not
                        meet Buyer’s expectations. As a result: (a) the Project may never be completed; (b) the
                        Project may not be completed as initially proposed by Company, and in a different or
                        modified form; (c) a blockchain utilizing or adopting features of the Project may ever be
                        launched; and (d) a blockchain may never be launched with or without changes to the
                        Project.
        <br/>
        14. Project Completion. The development of the Project may be abandoned for a
                        number of reasons, including, but not limited to, lack of interest from the public, lack of
                        funding, lack of commercial success or prospects, or departure of key personnel.
        <br/>
        15. Lack of Interest. Even if the Project is finished, launched and adopted, the
                        ongoing success of the Project relies on the interest and participation of third parties. There
                        can be no assurance or guarantee that there will be sufficient interest or participation in the
                        Project.
        <br/>
        16. Uncertain Regulatory Framework. The regulatory status of cryptographic tokens,
                        digital assets and blockchain technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is
                        difficult to predict how or whether governmental authorities may regulate such technologies.
                        It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether any governmental authority may make
                        changes to existing laws, regulations or rules that may affect cryptographic tokens, digital
                        assets, blockchain technology and its applications. Such changes could negatively impact
                        Coins in various ways, including, for example, through a determination that Coins are
                        regulated financial instruments that require registration. Company may cease the
                        distribution of Coins, the development of the Project or cease operations in a jurisdiction in
                        the event that governmental actions make it unlawful or commercially undesirable to
                        continue to do so.
        <br/>
        17. Risk of Government Action. The industry in which Company operates is new, and
                        may be subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny, including investigations or
                        enforcement actions. There can be no assurance that governmental authorities will not
                        examine the operations of Company or pursue enforcement actions against Company. Such
                        governmental activities may or may not be the result of targeting Company in particular.
                        All of this may subject Company to judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause
                        Company to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or
                        services, all of which could harm Company’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs,
                        which may in turn have a material adverse effect on the Coins or the development of the
                        Project.

         5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION
        </b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        1. Limitation of Liability. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Buyer
                        disclaims any right or cause of action against Company of any kind in any jurisdiction that
                        would give rise to any damages whatsoever, on the part of Company. Company shall not be
                        liable to Buyer for any type of damages, whether direct, indirect, incidental, special,
                        punitive, consequential or exemplary (including damages for lost profits, goodwill, use or
                        data), even if and notwithstanding the extent to which Company has been advised of the
                        possibility of such damages. Buyer agrees not to seek any refund, compensation or
                        reimbursement from the Company, regardless of the reason, and regardless of whether the
                        reason is identified in this Agreement. Company is not and shall not be responsible for or
                        liable for the market value of Coins, the transferability or liquidity of Coins or the
                        availability of any market for Coins through third parties or otherwise
        <br/>
        2. Damages. Under no circumstances shall the aggregate joint liability of the
                        Company, whether in contract, warrant, tort or other theory, for damages to Buyer under this
                        Agreement exceed the amount received by Company from Buyer.
        <br/>
        3. Release. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Buyer releases
                        Company from responsibility, liability, claims, demands, or damages of every kind and
                        nature, known and unknown (including, but not limited to, claims of negligence), arising out
                        of or related to disputes between Buyer and the acts or omissions of third parties.
        <br/>
        4. Force Majeure. Buyer understands and agrees that Company shall not be liable
                        and disclaims all liability to Buyer in connection with any force majeure event, including
                        acts of God, labor disputes or other industrial disturbances, electrical, telecommunications,
                        hardware, software or other utility failures, software or smart contract bugs or weaknesses,
                        earthquakes, storms, or other nature-related events, blockages, embargoes, riots, acts or
                        orders of government, acts of terrorism or war, technological change, changes in interest
                        rates or other monetary conditions, and, for the avoidance of doubt, changes to any
                        blockchain-related protocol.
        <br/>
        5. Indemnification.
        <br/>
        a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Buyer shall indemnify, defend
                        and hold harmless and reimburse Company from and against any and all actions,
                        proceedings, claims, damages, demands and actions (including without limitation
                        fees and expenses of counsel), incurred by Company arising from or relating to: (i)
                        Buyer’s purchase or use of Coins; (ii) Buyer’s responsibilities or obligations under
                        this Agreement; (iii) Buyer’s breach of or violation of this Agreement; (iv) any
                        inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of Buyer; (v) Buyer’s violation of any
                        rights of any other person or entity; or (vi) any act or omission of Buyer that is
                        negligent, unlawful or constitutes willful misconduct.
        <br/>
        b) Company reserves the right to exercise sole control over the defense, at Buyer’s
                        expense, of any claim subject to indemnification under this Section 5.5. This
                        indemnity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other indemnities set forth in a
                        written agreement between Buyer and Company.

        </b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        1. Informal Dispute Resolution. Buyer and Company shall cooperate in good faith to
                        resolve any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of, relating to or in connection with
                        this Agreement, including with respect to the formation, applicability, breach, termination,

                        jurisdiction.

        1. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed in all respects, including as to
                        validity, interpretation and effect, by the laws of the Republic of Korea.
        <br/>
        2. Assignment. Buyer shall not assign this Agreement without the prior written
                        consent of Company. Any assignment or transfer in violation of this Section shall be null
                        and void. Company may assign this Agreement to an affiliate. Subject to the foregoing,
                        this Agreement, and the rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder, shall be binding
