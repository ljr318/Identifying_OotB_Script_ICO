        In order to be eligible for a secured loan, you need something of value that can be used as collateral if you default on the loan. Assets that may be used for a secured loan include a property, vehicle, money in a savings account, a certificate of deposit or something else of high value.  You will also need to provide documents to the lender, such as proof of ID and documents relating to the assets you are using as security. Some lenders may also require you to have a good credit score.

        Yes, this is often known as a homeowner loan.  You can use your property as collateral for a loan. However, if you fail to keep up repayments, then your home could be repossessed by the lender.  Another option is to get a second mortgage. However, a secured loan is usually quicker to process and easier to apply for. Typically you end up paying less in interest for a secured loan than a second mortgage in the long term.

        The length of time it takes to receive funds after applying for a secured loan will vary between lenders. However, typically, it can take between three to six weeks in total. This is because the lender will need documents to ensure the collateral has value and is the legal property of the borrower.  A personal loan, on the other hand, is often quicker to process but acceptance is less likely.

       <p>
        A secured loan is where the borrower puts forward a high-value asset as collateral for the loan. The lender can then put a second charge of the asset, meaning they legally own the asset and can sell the asset if the borrower defaults on the loan.  For example, if the borrower uses their car or house for collateral, the borrower can still use their asset. However, if they fail to repay the loan, the lender can seize the asset, and it is now in legal possession of the lender. If you apply for a secured loan, be aware that your assets may be at risk.

        If you have sufficient assets (such as a car or home or high-value item) that can be used as collateral, then you are eligible for a secured loan. Even if you have bad credit, as long as you have collateral, you are likely to be approved for the loan.  Secured loans can be useful to help build a bad credit score and establish a credit history. Lenders will see you as less of a risk because you have put collateral in place in case you default on the loan and cannot pay it back.

        If you have a high-value asset available, then a secured loan can be a good financial option. A secured loan can help to build your credit history and improve your credit score if you make all of the repayments on time. Because of the collateral in the loan, the interest rates on a secured loan are generally lower than other types of loans, and they are suitable for those with bad credit too.  However, if you fail to make repayments or default on the loan, then your asset (such as your home or car) may be at risk and could be repossessed by the lender.

        It is usually possible to pay a secured loan off early. It will depend on the lender, but some lenders will charge a penalty or early-payment fee if you want to repay your loan back early.

        If you fail to make the repayments or fail to abide by the rules in your loan contract, then you are defaulting on your loan. Unless you can work out a resolution or agreement with the lender, then the lender will try to secure a court judgement. If this is successful, the lender will be able to seize the collateral and liquidate it. This means the borrower will lose their asset, whether this is a house, car or another valuable item.

        It is unlikely that a lender will be willing to write off a secured loan as they have a legal right to take possession of your collateral if you default on the loan or break the loan contract. Therefore, it’s more likely that a lender will seize your assets rather than writing off a loan.  If you are defaulting on a loan, then you should speak to the lender to come up with a solution. It may also help to talk to a debt charity too.

        In most secured loan contracts, it will state that you will not be able to sell the property while you have a secured loan on it, without the permission of a lender. In some cases, you may be able to convert your secured loan into an unsecured loan when you sell your property, and some lenders will be happy to transfer your secured loan over to your new property. However, the lender is not legally obligated to do this and can stop the sale going through.  If you want to sell your property, speak to your lender and find out what your options are.

        A secured loan is a separate loan to your mortgage, so you will have to pay back both loans. It is important to remember that secured loan lenders will prefer homeowners to have much equity as possible. A lender will determine your loan to value ratio by working out how much of your mortgage you have left to pay off. Usually, the best deals are when your loan to value (LTV) ratio is 60% or less.  The more equity you have in your home, the more a secured loan lender will be willing to let you borrow. This means there is more of the property that the lender can claim back if you default on your loan.

         Can I remortgage with a secured loan?

        It is possible to remortgage when you have a secured loan in place. If you remortgage, you may wish to increase the mortgage amount so you can clear your secured loan. This may incur early repayment fees for the loan; however, mortgage repayments are likely to be lower than a secured loan, and you’ll only have one debt to worry about.  Alternatively, you may be able to remortgage and keep the secured loan. However, you need to be clear with your mortgage lender that you have another loan in place on the property. A mortgage provider may not accept your application if you have a secured loan in place.

       <p>
        If you have an improved credit score or are able to receive better interest rates that can lower your monthly repayments, then remortgaging can be a great option. Although the monthly repayments will be cheaper than the repayments on a loan, a mortgage term is longer than a loan, and you will end up paying more for the mortgage in the long run.  If you have fixed term with your current mortgage provider, or your credit score has worsened, then it is often best to stick with the same mortgage and take out a separate loan.

        As the borrower uses an asset as collateral for a secured loan, lenders will see the loan as less risky. This means the interest rates are often lower and the repayment conditions are typically favourable. However, failing to keep up with the loan repayments will mean that the lender can repossess your assets which could be extremely costly in the long run.  Unsecured loans usually have higher interest rates than secured loans.

       <p>
        There are several options available for borrowers who want to make home improvements. The most common is a secured loan, or homeowner loan, which uses the property as collateral if you fail the repay the loan. Secured loans often have favourable interest rates. Another option is to remortgage the property to free up the cash for home improvements. This will usually extend the length of your loan.  You can also use a personal loan which does not require an asset for collateral but usually has a higher interest rate as a result. Alternatively, a 0% interest credit card can be useful for smaller home improvements; however, after the introductory rate, the interest rates may be very high.

Assets that may be used for a secured loan include a property, vehicle, money in a savings account, a certificate of deposit or something else of high value.  You will also need to provide documents to the lender, such as proof of ID and documents relating to the assets you are using as security. Some lenders may also require you to have a good credit score. "}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I get a loan secured against my house?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, this is often known as a homeowner loan.  You can use your property as collateral for a loan. However, if you fail to keep up repayments, then your home could be repossessed by the lender.  Another option is to get a second mortgage. However, a secured loan is usually quicker to process and easier to apply for. Typically you end up paying less in interest for a secured loan than a second mortgage in the long term. "}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How quickly can I get a secured loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The length of time it takes to receive funds after applying for a secured loan will vary between lenders. However, typically, it can take between three to six weeks in total. This is because the lender will need documents to ensure the collateral has value and is the legal property of the borrower.  A personal loan, on the other hand, is often quicker to process but acceptance is less likely. "}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How does a secured loan work?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A secured loan is where the borrower puts forward a high-value asset as collateral for the loan. The lender can then put a second charge of the asset, meaning they legally own the asset and can sell the asset if the borrower defaults on the loan.  For example, if the borrower uses their car or house for collateral, the borrower can still use their asset. However, if they fail to repay the loan, the lender can seize the asset, and it is now in legal possession of the lender. If you apply for a secured loan, be aware that your assets may be at risk. "}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you get a secured loan with bad credit?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"If you have sufficient assets (such as a car or home or high-value item) that can be used as collateral, then you are eligible for a secured loan. Even if you have bad credit, as long as you have collateral, you are likely to be approved for the loan.  Secured loans can be useful to help build a bad credit score and establish a credit history. Lenders will see you as less of a risk because you have put collateral in place in case you default on the loan and cannot pay it back. "}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is a secured loan a good idea?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"If you have a high-value asset available, then a secured loan can be a good financial option. A secured loan can help to build your credit history and improve your credit score if you make all of the repayments on time. Because of the collateral in the loan, the interest rates on a secured loan are generally lower than other types of loans, and they are suitable for those with bad credit too.  However, if you fail to make repayments or default on the loan, then your asset (such as your home or car) may be at risk and could be repossessed by the lender. "}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is secured loan example?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Usually, a secured loan will use a vehicle or property for the collateral. This means that the lender can repossess your car or home if you fail to make the repayments on your loan. Other assets that you may be able to use as collateral in a secured loan include jewellery, savings in the bank or a title or deed for a high-value item. "}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Are secured loans easier to get?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"As you are using an asset, such as your home or vehicle, as collateral for a secured loan, lenders will see you as less of a risk. As a result, secured loans are easier to be accepted for than an unsecured personal loan. As the risk is lower, individuals with a poor credit history or limited credit history as also more likely to be accepted for a secured loan compared to an unsecured loan. "}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you pay off a secured loan early?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"It is usually possible to pay a secured loan off early. It will depend on the lender, but some lenders will charge a penalty or early-payment fee if you want to repay your loan back early. Some lenders, however, will offer you a discount if you pay your loan back early. It is always best the check with the lender what your options for repaying the loan back early are before taking out the secured loan. "}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What happens when you default on a secured loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"If you fail to make the repayments or fail to abide by the rules in your loan contract, then you are defaulting on your loan. Unless you can work out a resolution or agreement with the lender, then the lender will try to secure a court judgement. If this is successful, the lender will be able to seize the collateral and liquidate it. This means the borrower will lose their asset, whether this is a house, car or another valuable item."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can a secured loan be written off?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"It is unlikely that a lender will be willing to write off a secured loan as they have a legal right to take possession of your collateral if you default on the loan or break the loan contract. Therefore, it\u2019s more likely that a lender will seize your assets rather than writing off a loan.  If you are defaulting on a loan, then you should speak to the lender to come up with a solution. It may also help to talk to a debt charity too. "}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do you need to use a broker for a secured loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"You can speak to lenders directly for a secured loan. However, it can often help to talk to an independent broker as they will be able to talk through the options available based on your individual circumstances. An independent broker can search through the market and may have advantageous rates with some lenders which a borrower would not be able to access themselves. A broker can also submit your application on your behalf, which can save you time and stress. "}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you sell a house with a secured loan on it?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"In most secured loan contracts, it will state that you will not be able to sell the property while you have a secured loan on it, without the permission of a lender. In some cases, you may be able to convert your secured loan into an unsecured loan when you sell your property, and some lenders will be happy to transfer your secured loan over to your new property. However, the lender is not legally obligated to do this and can stop the sale going through.  If you want to sell your property, speak to your lender and find out what your options are. "}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Does a secured loan affect your mortgage?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A secured loan is a separate loan to your mortgage, so you will have to pay back both loans. It is important to remember that secured loan lenders will prefer homeowners to have much equity as possible. A lender will determine your loan to value ratio by working out how much of your mortgage you have left to pay off. Usually, the best deals are when your loan to value (LTV) ratio is 60% or less.  The more equity you have in your home, the more a secured loan lender will be willing to let you borrow. This means there is more of the property that the lender can claim back if you default on your loan."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I remortgage with a secured loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"It is possible to remortgage when you have a secured loan in place. If you remortgage, you may wish to increase the mortgage amount so you can clear your secured loan. This may incur early repayment fees for the loan; however, mortgage repayments are likely to be lower than a secured loan, and you\u2019ll only have one debt to worry about.  Alternatively, you may be able to remortgage and keep the secured loan. However, you need to be clear with your mortgage lender that you have another loan in place on the property. A mortgage provider may not accept your application if you have a secured loan in place. "}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is it better to remortgage or get a loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"If you have an improved credit score or are able to receive better interest rates that can lower your monthly repayments, then remortgaging can be a great option. Although the monthly repayments will be cheaper than the repayments on a loan, a mortgage term is longer than a loan, and you will end up paying more for the mortgage in the long run.  If you have fixed term with your current mortgage provider, or your credit score has worsened, then it is often best to stick with the same mortgage and take out a separate loan. "}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Are secured loans cheaper?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"As the borrower uses an asset as collateral for a secured loan, lenders will see the loan as less risky. This means the interest rates are often lower and the repayment conditions are typically favourable. However, failing to keep up with the loan repayments will mean that the lender can repossess your assets which could be extremely costly in the long run.  Unsecured loans usually have higher interest rates than secured loans. "}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the best way to borrow money for home improvements?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"There are several options available for borrowers who want to make home improvements. The most common is a secured loan, or homeowner loan, which uses the property as collateral if you fail the repay the loan. Secured loans often have favourable interest rates. Another option is to remortgage the property to free up the cash for home improvements. This will usually extend the length of your loan.  You can also use a personal loan which does not require an asset for collateral but usually has a higher interest rate as a result. Alternatively, a 0% interest credit card can be useful for smaller home improvements; however, after the introductory rate, the interest rates may be very high. "}}]}
