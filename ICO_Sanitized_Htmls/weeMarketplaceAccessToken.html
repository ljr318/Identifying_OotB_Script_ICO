          LIMITED  FUNCTIONALITY
         </h5>
         <p class="card-text">
          In conventional loyalty and cashback programmes, users collect points, which have limited functionality because they can only be redeemed at participating outlets. This puts constant pressure on the loyalty provider to increase its number of partners to differentiate itself from competition. Instead of collecting loyalty points, wee users will now collect WPC, which has many use cases compared to traditional cashback points. WPC can be used for purchases at weePartners and all outlets accepting ERC20 tokens. In addition, it can be exchanged for cash, but also for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies..

          WITHDRAWALS
         </h5>
         <p class="card-text">
          When wee users want to withdraw their wee in the form of cash, this means having to handle a large amount of bank transfers, which are very time-consuming and require a lot of efforts from the company. Users may even lose some of their collected cashback due to high bank transfer fees. By replacing the existing wee points with the stable coin WPC, cash withdrawals will be handled much quicker and at lower transaction costs, making wee more attractive than conventional cashback programmes.

With the introduction of blockchain technology to the wee business model, data and information can easily be consolidated, as well as accessed quickly and at lower cost, making the organisation more efficient and facilitating management.

          The weePayCoin (WPC) is a stable coin created to function as payment means and to be used for borderless payments.

       3. YOUR RIGHTS. Pursuant to applicable data protection law you may have the following rights. Please note that these rights might be limited under the applicable national data protection law.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.1. RIGHT TO ACCESS PERSONAL DATA
      </p>
      <p>
       You have the right to confirm with us whether or not We process personal data about you and you also have the right to access the personal data and be provided with a copy of the personal data undergoing processing. For further copies requested by you,

      </p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-top: 0px;">

        Where we no longer require the personal data for the purpose of processing, but it is still required by an individual in connection with a legal claim.  In this case, the respective data will be marked and may only be processed by us for certain
                            purposes.
       </li>
      </ul>

      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, if your personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such
                        direct marketing. In this case your personal data will no longer be processed for such purposes by us.

       7. WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA / ENCRYPTION
      </p>
      <p>
       7.1. All personal data you provide to Us is stored exclusively on our secure servers and may be transferred to, and stored at a destination outside the European Economic Area (âEEAâ). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the
                        EEA who work for Us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. I.e., the personal data
                        that we collect or receive about you may be transferred to and processed by recipients which are located inside or outside the European Economic Area (âEEAâ) and which maybe do not provide for an adequate level of data
                        protection. The countries that are recognized to provide for an adequate level of data protection from an EU law perspective are Andorra, Argentina, Canada, Switzerland, Faeroe Islands, Guernsey, the State of Israel, Isle of Man,
                        Jersey, New Zealand and the Eastern Republic of Uruguay. Recipients in the US may partially be certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and thereby deemed to provide for an adequate level of data protection from an EU law perspective.
                        To the extent your personal data are transferred to countries that do not provide for an adequate level of data protection from an EU law perspective, we will base the respective transfer on appropriate safeguards, such as standard
                        data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission. You can ask for a copy of such appropriate safeguards by contacting us as set out under 11 below. The access is limited to recipients with a need to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       7.2. Any transactions will be encrypted using the latest SSL technology or better. In case we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to get access to our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.
                        We ask you not to share your password with anyone.

      <p>
       7.3. Please Note that We will never ask you to provide other personal or financial information such as passwords, date of birth, bank account balances, portfolio balances or your personal bank account details, or instruct you to pay funds into third party
                        bank accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       7.4. If you receive a communication from someone who claims to be from weeNexx AG and who asks you to provide your personal or financial information, this may indicate that you are the target of a scam. If this happens to you, please immediately report

       7.5. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although We will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Website; any transmission is at
                        your own risk. Once we have received your personal data, We will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.
      </p>

       8. STORAGE PERIOD
      </p>
      <p>
       Your personal data are stored only as long as this is required by law or as long as necessary for fulfilling the defined purpose. After the purpose has been attained or after expiry of the storage periods, We will remove it from our systems and records
                        and/or take steps to properly anonymize it so that you can no longer be identified from it, unless we need to keep your information, including personal data, to comply with legal or regulatory obligations to which We are subject,

       The material and information on this website are provided âas isâ and without warranties of any kind, either expressed or implied. weeNexx AG (âweeNexxâ) and its related, affiliated and subsidiary companies disclaim all warranties,
                            expressed or implied.
      </p>
      <p>
       In particular, no representations or warranties are made with respect to forward-looking statements and/or projections (e.g. financial, technical or business related) relating to weeNexx. We do not communicate any performance data
                            or forecasts and distance ourselves from any information that may be disclosed by third parties without our permission.
      </p>
      <p>
       To the extend permitted by law, we exclude all liability for any damages or consequential damages of any kind that may arise from or in connection with the use of this website.

       The published information and specifications on the Initial Token Offering are for information purposes only and do not constitute an offer or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell weeMarketplaceAccessToken ("WMA") in Switzerland
                            or abroad. Likewise, they do not constitute advice on legal, tax or other questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The distribution of the weeWhitepaper or any part thereof may be prohibited or restricted by the laws, regulatory requirements and rules of any jurisdiction. You are to inform yourself about, and to observe, any restrictions that
                            are applicable to your possession of the White Paper such part thereof (as the case may be) at your own expense and without liability of weeNexx.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blockchain also faces an uncertain regulatory landscape. The regulatory regime governing the Blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, tokens and token offerings such as weeMarketplace 2.0 and WIT is uncertain, and new regulations
                            or policies may materially adversely affect the development of weeNexx and weeMarketplace 2.0 and the utility of WIT
      </p>
      <p>
       Acquisition of WIT involves a high degree of risk.
      </p>
      <p>
       weeNexx may be the target of malicious cyber-attacks or may contain exploitable flaws in its underlying code, which may result in security breaches and the loss or theft of WIT. If weeNexx security is compromised or if weeNexx
                            is subjected to attacks that frustrate or thwart our usersâ ability to access the weeMarketplace 2.0 or their WIT or weeNexx data monetization services, users may cut back on or stop using the weeMarketplace 2.0 altogether,
                            which could seriously curtail the utilization of the WIT.
      </p>
      <p>
       weeNexx is committed to protecting the privacy and security of the personal information that is provided to us or collected by us during the course of our business. We process personal information in accordance with the Swiss Data
                            Protection Act and to the extent applicable the EU General Data Protection Regulation.
