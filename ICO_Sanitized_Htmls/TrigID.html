        Discussions with regulators and subsequent legal advice have forced us to re-evaluate how we fund the TrigID project.
       </p>
       <p>
        ALL funds collected during the token pre-sale have been returned in full and all in-kind contributions have been recorded.  We hope to compensate all of our supporters in some way in the near future. If you have any questions please email us at team@trigid.org.
       </p>
       <p>
        The team continues to believe in both the need for a safe universal identity framework and the social benefits made possible by a cryptographically-managed token economy.  We'll find a way.

        TrigID is a revolutionary new cryptographic technology that preserves your anonymity and privacy, but allows anyone to test the attributes that define your identity. This identity is
        <i>
         self-sovereign
        </i>
        – which means
        <strong>
         you
        </strong>
        have control over those attributes.

        Real world problems like finding your medical record when you're lying on an emergency room operating table.

       TrigID uses a novel scheme, inspired by geometric triangulation.  It takes common identifiers, encrypts them, then reduces their information content to 20 or fewer bits.  This “mashing algorithm” makes  what we call “Identity Vectors” that are really just arcs in a giant identity graph.
      </p>
      <p>
       These arcs are no use by themselves.  That's why they can encoded into a public blockchain.  One 20-bit Mash, for example, can represent more than 2000 possible tokens from identifiers of any type.  That's from the US alone, and it's before third parties start adding things like medical record ID's, tax file numbers...
      </p>
      <p>
       The TrigID graph can only confirm
       <strong>
        what you already know
       </strong>
       .

        TOKENS
       </h1>
       <p>
        ID tokens are a first-class TrigID crypto-infrastructure component.  Each token can carry a set of "arcs" or "edges" – lines that connects facts in the Global TrigID blockchain database.
       </p>
       <p>
        Think of these as the transactions in a database transaction log.   When you transfer them, the ID transaction becomes part of the TrigID database.  When someone wants to use the data, they parse the blockchain and assemble the TrigID graph the same way that a conventional database is assembled from a transaction log backup.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sure, ID tokens carry value – but the value assigned to them provides economic incentive to build the global identity database.  Holders who "spend" their tokens by putting arc data into them are rewarded with more ID tokens.  This way the creation of the global identity graph can be crowdsourced.

        We all want this to happen as soon as possible. To achieve this, a pool of ID tokens will be set aside to provide a powerful incentive to load data. Use your tokens to load data and you'll get back more than you spend.

        Token Ecosystem
       </h1>
       <p>
        Any worthwhile identity service depends on the integrity of stored identity data. To keep this data up-to-date and maintain its integrity, each service needs to be able to add to, or change, the details of identities they service. To do that, they must pass their updates via a curation service. They need ID tokens.
       </p>
       <p>
        To work with a TrigID curator, these identity services will need a reserve of tokens. Rather than repeatedly buying them on the open market, it makes sense that they should transact with tokens where possible. So they'll encourage the people and organisations consuming those identity services to also transact using ID tokens.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a powerful and virtuous circle, and it's the reason that we think that ID tokens can become "the" store of value for the online identity services economy.

       Valuing ID Tokens
      </h4>
      <p>
       How much is an identity worth?
      </p>
      <p>
       It depends on what a buyer is able to do with it. We do have some useful examples to base an assessment on: Facebook bought Instagram for $28 a user, then WhatsApp for $42 per user. That was nearly five years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, identity thieves will spend as much as $100 for comprehensive Identity data. In the US the average cost per identity-theft-related fraud is just over $1000. Simple Identity theft insurance costs $25-$60 annually. Add a little protection and monitoring and that becomes $100-$400.
      </p>
      <p>
       These and many more facts suggest that $50 is a more than reasonable estimate of the value of a digital identity, so that's what we use in our calculations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a look at the services that TrigID makes possible - the value of a universal and curated database of identity is immediately apparent. Your ID token is ultimately paying for the curation and maintenance of identity records, and that curation is what's making the TrigID identities valuable.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a one US dollar value in just the simple cleansing part of data curation (de-duping, attribute validation), so we've assessed the token's initial value to be USD $1.00. The market, however, will ultimately determine the worth of the Curation service and the ID token - as it does with all tradable commodities.

       ID Tokenomics
      </h4>
      <p>
       A cryptocurrency token economy is a powerful tool for influencing behaviour and getting work done. This power is even more revolutionary than the "blockchain" technology that makes it possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Predicting the behaviour of a token economy over time can be challenging, however. A token that behaves like money or a security makes for a simple model, but a token that has an actual use has an economy that is far more difficult to model and manage.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are some of the ID-Token-related issues we've had to address and will continue to address during the Community Consultation period:
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        • How do we allow for project growth but also make sure that early token buyers are rewarded for their faith in the project?
       </li>
       <li>
        • How many ID tokens do we need if we're giving them away as a reward for populating a 7,600,000,000 person Identity Graph?
       </li>
       <li>
        • How many can we let get into circulation before oversupply destroys their incentive value?
       </li>
       <li>
        • How much of the Graph can we populate before this happens and we have to close down the bounty program?
       </li>
       <li>
        • What submission rate can we permit before the Ethereum Virtual Machine starts to choke?
       </li>
       <li>
        • How much time do we need to allow for confirmation of new Identities and new Mashes?
       </li>
       <li>
        • How much of the Graph should Curators pre-load using readily-accessible sources?
       </li>
       <li>
        • Once the Graph is fully loaded, how many ID tokens are needed to support edits, births and deaths?
       </li>
       <li>
        • What happens if too many ID Token speculators choose to HODL?
       </li>
       <li>
        • How do we ensure that the poorest and least-advantaged get their identity created and maintained?
       </li>
       <li>
        • How do we prevent a threatened actor from using their purchasing power to stifle the project?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Early consultation and modelling has led us to this updated strategy:

      <p>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        • Each Curator issues bounty rewards from a small pool of ID tokens.
       </li>
       <li>
        • This pool is topped-up automatically by a proof-of-new-data-triggered token minting Replenishment Event.
       </li>
       <li>
        • Existing token holders are also issued additional tokens when a curator pool is replenished.
       </li>
       <li>
        • An electronic vote is conducted before each replenishment event.  Voters have the power to change key automated replenishment parameters, including the curator:holder token issue ratio.

       Strong Proof of Identity
      </h4>
      <p>
       Creating a few personal passphrases is a great way to allow a service locate you in their database, but it doesn't prevent people pretending to be you. A sophisticated bad actor can read the Mashes from blockchain and then give something that generates a collision. To prevent impersonation, you need to register a public key with the TrigID Identity Graph.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a service wants to prove you're you, there are a few steps they need to take behind the scenes. They need to create a message, encrypt it with your public key, then get you to decrypt it with your passphrase (or private key).
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't trust the service with your phrase or private key even for the few milliseconds it takes to decrypt the message (and you shouldn't, unless it's an emergency) you can use a trusted key intermediary service or use an app that will decrypt the message and send it back to the service.  The TrigID Personal app can do this for you.

       Verifying an identity's claims
      </h4>
      <p>
       Locating and confirming an identity is a highly-reliable event. For a 20-bit Mash, the chances of locating the wrong identity in the US from an SSN and Drivers Licence number is less than the chances of winning a typical national lotto game six times in a row.  And it only gets harder, the more Mashes you use.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's not true for information
       <span class="text-underline">
        about
       </span>
       an identity. 20 bits represents about a million vertices in the TrigID graph. For unique Unsafe values (Let's say SSNs on the US population) – the 20 arcs that point to typical TrigID will cover around 2000 values (SSNs).
      </p>
      <p>
       That will mean a one in 500 false positive error rate. If you're testing (say) Fred's proof-of-age for a bar, one error in 500 hundred is probably OK. But if you're testing whether you have the right medical record number for Fred, only a zero error rate is acceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The solution to this
       <span class="text-underline">
        false-positive-error
       </span>
       problem is two-factor verification of the truth or fact claimed. The same "triangulation" mechanism used to locate a TrigID can be used to verify a "truth".
      </p>
      <p>
       Any fact that you're wishing to confirm unequivocally using the TrigID graph will need to be entered with two arcs. In the case of Fred's medical record, it will need two numbers - which could, of course, be existing Mash values.

       The Dictionary Filter Problem
      </h4>
      <p>
       In a Dictionary Attack a large list or "dictionary" of values is sequentially applied against an application in the hope of finding one that the application will accept.  Usually the dictionary contains passwords and the "attack" hopes to gain access to some account.
      </p>
      <p>
       The strategy can, however, also be used for other purposes.  A bad actor – pretending to be Fred – could, for example, apply to set up a bank account using a dictionary of SSNs.  With more than 300,000,000 SSNs in use, however, such an attack is never going to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a bad actor knows enough about Fred to isolate his TrigD vertex, however, he can use the TrigID graph to turn that 300,000,000 SSNs into just 2000 – as we saw in the exercise above.  2000 applications spread over several days could well result in one that's successful.
      </p>
      <p>
       We call this the Dictionary Filter Problem.  Once a TrigID graph is loaded and live, governments, banks, and other custodians of your identity will need their applications to be much more vigilant.

       Ensuring Data Integrity
      </h4>
      <p>
       The Curated ID Bounty Program provides a powerful incentive to load identities and their attributes.  Those same bounties, however, are an incentive to load fake identities and attributes or attributes without sufficient notability.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is one of the key reasons for giving an ID token a value and requiring that the ID be spent to deliver data.  Most fraudulent submissions will be detectable using graph analysis techniques.  Get caught and your bounties and your valuable submitted ID tokens will be forfeited.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the program features that will be used to ensure data integrity:
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        • All bounty program submissions must be provably linked to a TrigID.
       </li>
       <li>
        • Confirmation bounties for independent second, third and fourth duplicate submissions.
       </li>
       <li>
        • Validation periods that allow time for confirmation submissions and collusion testing.
       </li>
       <li>
        • Foundation Identity Record requirements including a minimum arc count and at least one Attestation Relationship
       </li>
       <li>
        • Extended validation escrow.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The details of these and other rules and strategies will be communicated and fine-tuned during the community consultation period.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a smaller scale, there will always be those who wish to create the equivalent of a "false passport" to support illegal activity. There's no way to prevent this, but the Universal Identity Graph will make it easier to track the use of such false identities.

       Towards an Identity Oracle
      </h4>
      <p>
       A blockchain
       <i>
        Smart Contract
       </i>
       is a powerful piece of software, but there are limits to its reach. If it needs data, that data has to be already in the blockchain machine and available to the
       <i>
        Smart Contract
       </i>
       in a form that it can use. If the contract needs to check an identity, for example, it has to rely on an external application to observe that need, go fetch the identity information and then feed it back to the contract. That external application is referred to as an "oracle".
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no broadly useful oracle for identity. If there were, a whole new world of automated, immediate, incorruptible and cheap-to-transact commerce would be possible. Automated bank account creation and border protection. Automated transfer of everything from cars to houses. Automated payment of social security entitlements and insurance claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       A populated TrigID Identity Graph makes such an oracle possible. What's more, since TrigID gets its data from the blockchain, it's possible for the identity oracle to be trustless and decentralized. All that's needed is the software to make it run. Our development partner FactNexus Pty Ltd has undertaken to open-source a TrigID-focussed version of its GraphBase DBMS for this purpose.

       TrigID will initially be implemented over the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is powerful, proven and popular but there are concerns about its scalability and its overly-centralised governance.
      </p>
      <p>
       The TrigID project has been built to be blockchain-agnostic and easy-to-migrate. This means there's no need for it to confine its records to a single distributed ledger. EOS, NEO, Cardano, Dfinity, IOTA are all potentially suited and there are many other public distributed ledgers in the pipeline. One or more of these can be a suitable new home for TrigID Mash data should the need arise.

          Why TrigID is Different
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         The biggest difference between TrigID and any other digital identity technology – blockchain-based or otherwise - is that TrigID lets Personally Identifiable Information (PII) be safely stored and used in
         <strong>
          public
         </strong>
         . That PII can be publicly audited and validated, and it points to one, and only one, identity for every human. Putting it in public blockchain means that It can't be tampered with, it must be maintained by consensus and that it can be used by
         <strong>
          everyone.
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         No other digital identity technology – blockchain-based or otherwise – can make these claims.

         Alternatively, you can interact with him using a video calling app and verify his face-image or voice print.

        <p>
         TrigID also makes possible a single repository of KYC information, or a gateway that uses a federated query to find that information.  Any entity that wants to set up such a service should start aggregating and collecting information for it now so that they can be first to offer it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Any service will be able to use TrigID to match collected records and cleanse any identifiers.  Ideally, though, it should retain its KYC information anonymously, to comply with increasingly stringent regulatory privacy requirements.  It can achieve this by assembling and maintaining it's own private Identity Graph and attaching anonymised KYC data to each identity.

         Any entity tasked with detecting and prosecuting money-laundering activity can also maintain their own private Identity graph.  The "one person, one identity" guarantee will dramatically simplify data-matching and cleansing tasks and ensure that reported KYC data is more valuable.  Known network relationships can be superimposed over the graph and new ones inferred using country, town, street address or family name dictionary filters.

         The Universal Identity Graph will make it much harder for criminals and terrorists to hide their activities. The Graph won't tell an enforcement entity anything they don't already know, but it will make it signficanlty easier to
         <u>
          use
         </u>
         what they know.
        </p>
        <p>
         The anonymity provided by the Identity Graph means that any enforcement entity can make
         <strong>
          anonymous alert frameworks
         </strong>
         available to their agents - secure in the knowledge that key intelligence won't be accidentally or deliberately used to "tip off" a suspect.
        </p>
        <p>
         A pre-existing, community-maintained Identity Graph will significantly reduce the burden of keeping these alert frameworks up-to-date with current phone numbers, addresses, email addresses and other easily-changed identifiers.

         Every year, a quarter of a million people die from medical error in the US alone.  They die because they don't receive the right care at the right time.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most of these errors are the result of systemic problems – poorly-coordinated care and lack of timely information, both caused in-part by fragmented and incomplete records.
        </p>
        <p>
         Lack of timely information also leads to waste.  Tests and imaging are regularly repeated unnecessarily and more than 10% of hospital expenditure is spent correcting preventable mistakes. According to a 2012 National Academy of Medicine report, thirty percent of US health care spending is wasted on unnecessary or poorly-delivered services and other needless costs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Inability to find or match fragmented health records is a major problem. In a 2014 assessment, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology in the US found that the best error rate is around seven percent. Worse still, the error rate is usually more than ten percent within a healthcare entity, and double that when entities exchange with each other.

         Identity theft is part of a much larger problem - Identity Fraud.  If a bad actor "borrows" your identity for a single transaction, it's generally not considered to be theft of your identity, but it can be costly and damaging nonetheless.   Last year in the US alone, nearly 17 million people reported that they were victims of identity fraud.

         If a seller isn't who they claim to be, you have no comeback if the goods are stolen or the services aren't what was sold to you.  If a buyer fails to complete payment and your own goods or services have already been delivered you have no way to chase them down.
        </p>
        <p>
         Is the person you're transacting with really who they say they are?   Is that the person you're sending money to the same person that's on the registration papers of the car you're buying?  Does the credit card number you're being given really belong to the person you're sending your goods to?

         Identity for Everyone
        </h4>
        <p>
         More than a billion third-world humans have no identity.  Without an identity, you don't count.  You're no-one. You can't get access to health care, education, financial services or state-provided social benefits.  170 million of these no-ones are children. Children who can't be identified and tracked are routinely kidnapped and sold as a sex slaves.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nowhere is this more heartbreaking than in the world's refugee camps.  Refugees are  people who once had homes, friends and identities defined by the country they've been forced to leave.  Now they struggle just to get their daily rations of food and supplies in an identityless environment where criminal elements can easily steal their share.
        </p>
        <p>
         TrigID is identity you're given as soon as you have a name and a parent, and you can strengthen it at any time with attestations provided by governments and other third parties.  And once you have it, you can't lose it or have it taken away.

        <p>
         Two billion of the world's adults are what's referred to as "unbanked".  They don't have a bank account of any kind.  This means that they can't safely save or borrow money or enter into trading arrangements.
        </p>
        <p>
         There's no way for them to buy a house or vehicle for their family, save for their children's education, buy insurance or undertake anything but the simplest of cash businesses. Benefits that that those of us in the developed world take for granted.
        </p>
        <p>
         It should be no surprise then to learn that financial inclusion is considered to be a key enabler of the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals.
        </p>
        <p>
         Part of the problem is that without adequate proof of identity you just can't open a bank account.  Or obtain the credit card that gives you immediate use of what's in that bank account.
        </p>
        <p>
         TrigID gives you an identity you can prove.  With that, perhaps you don't even need a credit card.  That's an opportunity, and great news for the three billion people who live on less that $2.50 a day, because the credit card fees alone would make commerce using them unsustainable.

         At first glance, a national identification system with ID cards sounds like a great idea.  Join fragmented records into one big database so that government can deliver care and services better. Track crminals and terrorists.  Reduce illegal immigration and social security fraud.
        </p>
        <p>
         Current systems just aren't good enough.  Every day thousands of people are inconvenienced, marginalized, given wrong or inadequate care or have their identities stolen.
        </p>
        <p>
         We need something better.
        </p>
        <p>
         But do we really trust government enough to give them complete control of our identity?  A centralised database that knows all about us is a powerful tool for government officers, but do we really believe that every government employee will use that power honestly and with our best interests at heart?
        </p>
        <p>
         Can they make and keep that database accurate?  According to the US Attorney General a third of US criminal records have information that is wrong.  If government can't manage the records of the most dangerous people in our society, what hope is there for
         <u>
          our
         </u>
         records?  Errors will mean bad credit, travel restrictions, false arrests...
        </p>
        <p>
         A centralised government database would be an irresistable target for criminal identity thieves.  Lobby groups too - employers, landlords, insurers, credit agencies, private investigators and more would demand access to what is, after all, a publicly-owned resource.  Give them access, and we've given them the power to discriminate en masse
        </p>
        <p>
         TrigID promises a better way. Findability, checkability and the power to put decentralised records together when needed - without loss of privacy.  The power to keep our own records and the records of those we care about correct.  Able to work with today's analog identifiers and tomorrow's digital and biometric identifiers.  Decentralised, immutable and unhackable.

        <p>
         Facebook carries the identity – together with the interests, politics, religion, fetishes and buying behaviour - of more than two billion people.  If you're a member, it knows about pages you've looked at all over the web.  It knows where your phone has been, it analyses what's in the photos you take.  It keeps every message you've ever sent to, or received from, anyone.  It knows the name and number of everyone on your phone even if they're not Facebook friends.  It knows more about you than your government does.
        </p>
        <p>
         No matter how well-meaning the team at Facebook might be, that's too much power in the hands of one central enterprise.  When they make a mistake, it hurts too many people - as we've seen with the recent Cambridge Analytica debacle.
        </p>
        <p>
         What's more, Facebook's success has created an unassailable near-monopoly.  If we want to easily and digitally interact with our friends as a group then Facebook or one of its assets is the way we must do it.
        </p>
        <p>
         The price we pay for this utility is a monocultural, Facebook-only view of our social world – a stale blue landscape lacking the innovation and vibrancy that comes from competion.  A world where privacy is a second-class citizen.
        </p>
        <p>
         TrigID can change this.  How?  Your social network is something that exists separate from Facebook, and the TrigID Identity Graph makes it possible for you to define your social graphs independent of any social network.
        </p>
        <p>
         At its heart Facebook, LinkedIn and other social-network-based applications are just blogs - with news and message feeds to and from your network.
        </p>
        <p>
         Imagine a world where you could pick your own on-line social presence and social view from any of hundreds of options.  One that suits your personality, your feed, advertising (including your own) and privacy preferences.  Each of your friends can pick a presence that's entirely different.
        </p>
        <p>
         Then each of you can just plug in your secure, anonymous TrigID-referenced social graph and get the social network experience you choose.  With no centralized monolith to spoil the party.

         Universal Data De-identification
        </h4>
        <p>
         Since 2013, nearly 10 billion data records have been lost or stolen world-wide.  That's five million a  day.  In 2017, there were more than 1500 data breaches in the US alone, at an average cost to the organization breached of over seven million dollars.
        </p>
        <p>
         Experts agree, no matter how much security you have in place, if you're big enough to be a target
         <u>
          you will eventually be breached
         </u>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         A data breach is not an organization's only data-related risk.  Each year brings increasingly stringent regulations designed to protect individual privacy.  Europe's new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the US Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) are important examples.  These regulations stipulate costly management processes for Personally Identitiable Information (PII) and promise stiff penalties if you fail to comply.
        </p>
        <p>
         The only way to be certain that identity thieves can't steal PII and that you fully comply with  PII-related statute is to
         <u>
          not store that PII at all
         </u>
         .

        <p>
         TrigID makes it possible to de-identify any and all personal records.  To accurately find a person's records at any time, the organisation just needs to keep a local TrigID sub-graph that connects record keys. Or use a service that does it for them.

         Data Cleansing
        </h4>
        <p>
         De-identification using TrigID is a powerful and effective strategy for privacy if all you need to do is locate a record or confirm something about an identity.  Some personal data, however, can't be de-itentified and still be useful.  Mailing lists (physical and email), for example, need to retain the addresses or mail can't be delivered.
        </p>
        <p>
         Keeping list information accurate is a significant problem for most enterprises. 20% of PII records in a typlcal set have at least one attribute that is wrong.  These errors compromise analytics and decision making and often lead to wrongful disclosure, waste and embarassment – for example when sending mail to a wrong address or misspelling a name.
        </p>
        <p>
         A populated and well-maintained TrigID Identity graph will make it possible to test the accuracy of PII by testing all of the identity's attributes against the graph.  If they're commonly-used atrtibutes, like name, SSN, phone number, address or drivers license number, and they fail - they're probably wrong.   This process will also find duplicates and uncover fake identities and addresses.
        </p>
        <p>
         The TrigID graph also supports cleansing of misspellings.  The Mash algorithm generates a Soundex Mash for each spoken string, allowing many misspelled attributes to be matched.
