          You are responsible for maintaining your own wallet. Bodhi is a decentralized application, with no centralized mechanism for accessing your wallet.

Mismanagement of your wallet details may cause you to lose all your funds that may not be recoverable. We are not responsible for the loss of such funds arising from entering the wrong wallet details.
