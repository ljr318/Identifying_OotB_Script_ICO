        1. If both Pending Balance and Total paid don't show up
       </p>
       <p>
        In this case, mining is not working well. There should be some issues. Double check your 'start.bat' and wallet address.
       </p>
       <p>
        2. Pending Balance shows up, but Total paid doESN't show up
       </p>
       <p>
        It means that mining is working well, but it is not paid yet. It usually take some time to pay depend on hash rate. Therefore, you can get paid after few hours in general. However, ask to pool manager for this issue if it is not paid after few hours. There could be some issues on the mining pool.
       </p>
       <p>
        3. Both Pending Balance and Total paid show up, but no balance on your wallet
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no issue on your mining. Check version of your wallet or synchronize the wallet
