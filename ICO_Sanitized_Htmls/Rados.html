            <p>
             With the emergence of Bitcoin in 2009 and release of its source code, some gambling entities realized its striking potential as a payment means. Today, Bitcoin continues its victory march across the world and embraces an increasing number of people who bet in online casinos. The essence and technical details underpinning this digital currency seem to be obscure for an overwhelming majority of common users – just recall how Tesla CEO Elon Musk tried to explain Bitcoin to JK Rowling in a Twitter post. In layman’s terms, Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency that exists in an electronic form only.
            </p>
            <h2>
             Advantages of the best bitcoin casinos
            </h2>
            <p>
             US Bitcoin casinos are fairly numerous these days. Basically they offer the same variety of gaming options, bonuses and entertainment value as “traditional” online casinos, yet they boast of a few upsides that set them apart. To begin with, online casino gaming is outlawed in most US states, except for Delaware, New Jersey and Nevada where it is explicitly legal. Though Congress banned online gaming in 2006, there are still many controversial provisions and conflicts between state and federal laws. In fact, online casinos that accept bitcoins turn out to be a lifeline for many people who want to play at the comfort of their home instead of heading to the Vegas Strip.
            </p>
            <p>
             One of the most coveted advantages rooted in the nature of Bitcoin is anonymity of bitcoin holders. In fact, experts tend to use the word “pseudonymous” in this regard, because law enforcement agencies can still track and trace from where specific bitcoins are originated from. However, the best bitcoin casinos adhere to keeping their customers’ identity concealed, therefore ordinary users can be sure they have their identity totally safe and secure.
            </p>
            <p>
             Faster withdrawal procedures are another big edge of digital currencies. Online casinos normally process payout requests within 24 to 72 hours, after which a player gets the money cleared and waits for it to arrive. And many players just hate having to wait for several days until the funds reflect on the account. Contrary to that, Bitcoins are transferred almost instantaneously, wi
            </p>
            <p>
             thin 30 to 60 minutes or so. In some situations, a player can choose to pay an extra transaction fee to accelerate a transaction by decreasing the number of confirmations.

Prompt signup is another upside for some gamblers who find it irritating to fill in numerous mandatory fields on registration forms. Normally, bitcoin casinos in US require guests to create a login (alias) and password and give a valid email, which is performed in seconds flat.
            </p>
            <h2>
             Choosing the best US bitcoin casino
            </h2>
            <p>
             Actually, picking a good, reliable and trustworthy bitcoin casino is a challenge for some gamblers. Many players visit bitcoin casinos haphazardly, being lured by advertisements on the internet but in fact these can be rogue casinos. To find a safe and secure bitcoin casino that always sticks to the best practices in the industry and delivers on its financial commitments, players should conduct a serious online research and read players’ feedback on professional forums. Alternatively, players should peruse unbiased expert reviews (like the ones published here) which are based on scrupulous observation and research of numerous bitcoin casinos in the USA. Properties and features that should be considered in picking the best bitcoin casino are:
            </p>
            - Diverse, big and versatile collection of games
- Friendly payment limits effective for deposit and withdrawal
- Knowledgeable Support team that should be available through more than a single channel (email, live chat, phone, etc.) and be able to resolve issues quickly
- Well-devised promotions, seasonal deals and VIP program 
- Reputation with gambling communities.
            <p>
             Bitcoin casinos featured on this website have been handpicked as the most reputable, time-tested and scam-free gaming sites.

            <h2>
             Getting started in a US bitcoin casino
            </h2>
            <p>
             Upon picking the most suitable bitcoin casino, a player should complete a very simple and fast registration process to be able to bet real BTC. Some casinos provide step-by-step guidelines on how to buy and where to store bitcoins, so even bitcoin novices will easily grab the basics and proceed to playing almost immediately. Another important step is to read carefully casino’s terms of use to avoid unexpected issues related to withdrawal limits, bonus wagering etc. Some casinos have non-gaming content (Blog, Gambling Articles, Blackjack Strategies Explained) aimed at educating and informing gamblers on different topics, and inexperienced punters should not ignore it.

          <h2>
           Bitcoin casino bonuses
          </h2>
          <p>
           Traditional online casinos, by and large, tend to offer a decent bonus program for all players involved in gaming, from newcomers to veterans. And these bonuses more often than not are equal to a few thousand dollars in a best-case scenario. In the realm of US bitcoin casinos, they have much bigger bonuses for beginners and regular reload bonuses. For example, some casinos offer welcome packages that reach into 2 or 3 bitcoins and higher. Besides, bitcoin casinos generally offer low-sized wagering requirements, which tend to be lower than x50 times a deposited amount. Bitcoin casinos in the USA normally have extensive bonus programs aimed at regular players. These include generous free spins, cashback and slot tournaments that run on a recurrent or permanent basis.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Provably Fair concept in bitcoin casinos
          </h2>
          <p>
           Players are afraid of being cheated by online casinos. When reels are spinning or dice are rolling inside a virtual environment, some gamblers feel unsure about fairness of a game round, especially if a losing streak is long. Regular online casinos that operate only fiat currencies provide no tools for a user to check the game integrity. As contrasted to mainstream gambling sites, some of the best bitcoin casinos have implemented what is known as the Provably Fair technology that enables one to verify the result of each round and reinforce that the results have not been compromised. In simplistic terms, the Provably Fair method works like that: each result in a slot spin or dice roll is calculated using two variables, that is a server seed and client seed. By hashing the server seed and comparing the hashes with a special tool on the casino site, it is possible to see whether a player was cheated or not. Actually, the Provably Fair concept is a definitive reason in favor of bitcoin casinos.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Game variety in bitcoin casinos
          </h2>
          <p>
           Online casinos that accept bitcoins actually have an impressive assortment of slots, blackjack, roulette and other games from numerous vendors. The centerpiece of most casinos is slots that can number a few hundred titles within one gambling site. Slots are of different types, including modern five-reel solutions, classic three-reel products, progressive slots and some exotic, offbeat variations with more than 5 reels. In bitcoin casinos, winnings derived from slots are paid out in BTC. Bet sizes are also different in slots and they are aimed at different categories of player bankrolls. Actually, bitcoin casinos offer nearly identical library of games as traditional online casinos. The only difference is that all bets are placed in the digital currency.
          </p>
          <p>
           In addition to slots, casino lobbies are often full of table games released by leading software companies. In some online casinos, bitcoins are used to place bets in live dealer tables that are managed by professional, skilled croupiers and allow customizing video quality, sound and other parameters.
          </p>
          <p>
           Online casinos that accept bitcoins have a high entertaining value for ordinary users. Abundant with all kinds of games, bonuses and tournaments, they come up with second-to-none security, anonymity and fast payouts – features that are especially relevant for both recreational and passionate gamers in the US.
