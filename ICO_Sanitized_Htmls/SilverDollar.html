      Is inflation devaluing your currency?
     </h2>
     <p>
      The more inflation reduces the value of your currency, the more you should invest in direct ownership of silver, reinvented as modern money.
     </p>
     <p>
      Here’s some good news:
      <i>
       You can buy more silver today than you can tomorrow.
      </i>
     </p>
     <h2 class="heading">
      More Enduring then Government Currency
     </h2>
     <p>
      Unlike government currency, every SilverToken is your direct private ownership of investment-grade silver.
     </p>
     <p>
      The tokens can be used for transactions on the worldwide blockchain via the secure Ethereum Global Network.
     </p>
     <p>
      But it can also be used as real money, sold for US dollars, or redeemed for silver.
     </p>
     <p>
      And unlike government currency, every SilverToken represents direct ownership of silver, which means you can be confident it will retain its value. In fact, silver has maintained its value for thousands of years.
     </p>
     <h2 class="heading">
      Why it's better than buying real silver
     </h2>
     <ul>
      <b>
       If you invest in real silver, ask yourself:
      </b>
      <li>
       How much silver am I willing to keep at my home before it becomes a security risk?
      </li>
      <li>
       If I put my silver in a private vault and it needs to be transferred because of political issues, how difficult is the transfer going to be?
      </li>
      <li>
       If I need to sell my silver. How difficult will it be and at what price?
      </li>
      <li>
       Now that I have all the silver in a private vault, how can I use it as money?
      </li>
      <br/>
      <b>
       On the other hand, with the digital Silver Token and Silver Dollar, you invest in real silver, but:
      </b>
      <li>
       Owning it is never a security risk. Your real silver is vaulted by us, insured, and guarded 24/7.
      </li>
      <li>
       Your Silver Tokens and Silver Dollars represent your vaulted silver, which you can have delivered anywhere, any time.
      </li>
      <li>
       You can use it as real money on the blockchain or in a local store.
      </li>

     <h2 class="heading">
      Better for use than Bitcoin
     </h2>
     <p>
      Since the value of a SilverDollar is pegged at 1.00 USD, it provides an easier and more reliable way than Bitcoin to calculate the cost of purchases.
     </p>
     <h2 class="heading">
      More stable than cryptocurrencies
     </h2>
     <h3>
      Here’s why:
     </h3>
     <p>
      When a token is backed with government currency, the problems of inflation and  the erosion of purchasing power remain.
     </p>
     <p>
      By contrast, with SilverTokens you always know the purchasing power of your money.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Another advantage – the value of your investment grows
     </h3>
     <p>
      Each time a SilverToken is used in a transaction, a 1% transaction fee is incurred. A portion of the fee is used to increase the silver each token represents. As a result, the more SilverTokens are used as money, the more silver your SilverTokens represent. By contrast, currency does not increase in value.
     </p>
     <h3>
      It’s the end of currency uncertainty – and the Modern Silver Standard
     </h3>
     <p>
      At long last, you can enjoy the end of currency uncertainty – with our SilverTokens for secure savings and transactions. SilverDollars for stable everyday spending in the brick-and-mortar world. It’s the silver standard, re-created for today’s digital world.
