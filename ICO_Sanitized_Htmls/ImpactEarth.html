        <p>
         The world is facing global challenges for sustainable development with focus on:
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          reducing CO2 emissions globally to reduce the effects of climate change
         </li>
         <li>
          urbanisation, solving the demand for affordable housing in urban and off grid rural areas
         </li>
         <li>
          energy transition, reducing energy consumption using smart, climate design, producing renewable energy on site, and storing and distributing energy though smart networks
         </li>
         <li>
          addressing water, food and resource scarcity through resource efficient design strategies
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Impact Earth’s approach to these problems is circular and inclusive,
         <strong>
          creating ecological and social value for its customers through community building and education managed on the Ethereum blockchain for transparency and control.
         </strong>
         Impact investing is a way of investing that creates financial returns for the investor and that makes the world a better and more sustainable place at the same time. Impact projects are typically designed to make communities more sustainable and reduce CO2, to create jobs and provide people with means to improve their livelihood and generate income which will enable them to repay the investors.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, in many cases these investments are difficult to find, not transparent, difficult to manage and measure. Investment funds, institutions, companies and governments are struggling to do so.

         The Impact Earth Foundation will be able to offer a portfolio of services to our target clients.

The solution will reduce the current ineﬃciencies and inaccuracies over the lifetime of the impact investment in real assets like real estate, green energy farms, etc., and will put transparent measurements and processes in place needed to monitor, manage and ultimately sell the asset. Linking digital identities of properties to the digital identities of owners and tenants/customers and transparent records on impact creation and CO2 reduction will create valuable online records for each real asset and will offer a clear and transparent track record.

          This unique flexible housing concept that will provide affordable houses for the less privileged and aims to facilitate access to proper housing for everyone and creates sustainable communities that will support CO2 reduction. The concept is based on the use of BIM (Building Information Modelling) and a highly efficient, on site production facility that can be run by locally trained personnel. Local architects will be selected to design low cost housing typologies using the tools and components from the predetermined BIM library. In so doing, the consortium has bypassed the issues of culture, climate and local building regulations, ensuring that supply meets demand and that the design solutions are contextually based. The BIM models can directly be used for the engineering and production of the components on site, thereby reducing production costs and enabling endless variations. The picture shows the onside factory that fits within an container.

            A lot of expertise comes into play when making a sustainable investment in developing countries. Knowledge is necessary not only to select sound and viable projects but also to create legally sound structures and to monitor on-going projects from commencement to completion. With our affiliated company Realty Africa, we have a lot of experience in origination of the best Impact Investments and we will create a fund that will pre-finance these Impact projects with good returns. We have many projects waiting in the pipeline to start after the ICO is finished. One of the first projects would be the refurbishment and expansion of a student housing complex in the City of Johannesburg which can house more than 100 students from the University of Johannesburg. There is a huge need for good quality affordable student accommodation.

        <p>
         Government, institutions and Industry participants will have the following goals under the Paris Agreement:
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          To develop or improve
          <strong>
           corporate sustainability guidelines
          </strong>
          that describe their commitments to economic, environmental, safety and social sustainability in communities where they operate.
         </li>
         <li>
          To reduce their carbon footprint by participating in proven
          <strong>
           CO2 reduction projects
          </strong>
          anywhere and report on it.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         However, executing these goals is not so easy. The main challenges our clients face are:

         <li>
          Lack of in-house knowledge on participating in or implementing sustainable projects

          The Impact Earth service offering
         </h3>
        </div>
        <p>
         With the three components as mentioned above, we can create several services offerings to cater for our target customers:
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Origination on request of full turnkey Impact Asset investment:
          </strong>
          Companies and institutions will have the obligation to improve their social responsibility and sustainability profile. Using the full potential of Impact Earth, we can find projects, originate them, put the finance structure in place and manage the total project on the blockchain platform
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Manage in-house origination on the IMPACTXO platform:
          </strong>
          Institutions with the potential to originate their own projects can use the platform to manage their project and create a track record.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Pre-financing small impact investments and creating a portfolio:
          </strong>
          Impact Earth can pre-finance small Impact Investments via our originating platform Realty Africa and create a portfolio. When the portfolio has enough substance, the portfolio will be offered to investors or the tokens will be combined and offered for an ICO.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Affordable Housing projects:
          </strong>
          We come across land purchase opportunities on a regular basis in places where there is a huge need for affordable housing and the creation of more sustainable communities. Impact Earth with the help of the local Realty Africa teams, can develop these projects and offer them to institutions for investment or pre-finance the project as part of a portfolio.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           CO2 reduction projects:
          </strong>
          Under the Paris Agreement, many companies have a need to reduce their Carbon Footprint. This can be done by buying into CO2 reduction projects. The projects that we originate in affordable housing combined with clean energy sources, ECO-lodges or local solar farms, offer a huge CO2 reduction potential and will be an interesting investment or be eligible for UN funding. The asset and the CO2 reduction is managed and measured on the blockchain platform.
         </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Yellow page directory of all industry specialists:

         The database of Market Participants will be made available as a subscription service to find the best Real Estate specialist in the countries that Impact Earth will be active.

         The funds raised with the ICO are distributed over the three pillars of the Impact Earth Foundation according to the overview below:
        </p>
        <p>
         <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/impact2.jpg"/>
        </p>
        <p>
         These three elements will all generate a profit to the benefit of our IMPACTXO Coin holders. At least 70% of net profit after tax) will be distributed to IMPACTXO holders quarterly each year.
        </p>
        <p>
         The demand for Impact Projects is growing every year. According to a survey by the Global Impact Investment Network (
         <a href="http://rab.one/GIIN">
          http://rab.one/GIIN
         </a>
         ), the market is growing by 17% to 20% a year and the total amount invested globally is more than 114 Billion USD. The report shows that return expectation by Impact Investors is close to market rate returns for more than 84% of the investors.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Impact Earth Foundation makes money from cash flows earned on:
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          Offering our blockchain solution to companies and institutions for managing their investments
         </li>
         <li>
          Developing sustainable projects with the housing solution
         </li>
         <li>
          Finding and originating Impact Assets that are subsequently sold on to companies or institutions that want to improve their sustainability profile or reduce their carbon footprint.
         </li>
         <li>
          Creating portfolios of pre-financed projects managed on our IMPACTXO platform which are subsequently sold to an investor.
         </li>
         <li>
          The yellow pages subscription model
         </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
         The key to the IMPACTXO concept is the focus on Real Assets that hold value and serve as collateral. We believe that the Real Asset Impact investment model will drive the future value of IMPACTXO to levels far beyond the launch price backed by its assets, generating positive cash flows, equity participations and cash pool. Either way, the IMPACTXO token value increases substantially when the value of the underlying asset increases.
        </p>
        <p>
         Returns are distributed to our coin holders in the form of Earth Tokens on a quarterly basis. A pool of cash held by the Transparent Concepts Company will support the Earth Tokens.

          The belief that an interdisciplinary approach to design leads to
sustainable spaces and an enhanced user experience led
architect Duzan Doepel and interior architect Eline Strijkers to
team up in 2007 to form DoepelStrijkers. Driven by a
fascination for aesthetics with substance, they generate work
that transcends the spatial by creating social, ecolog-ical and
economic value. Giving form to the process and financing is
just as important as the design itself. A firm belief that design
can act as an agent for social renewal leads to strategies that
contribute to both a circular and inclusive economy. In 2017
Chantal Vos joined the team as partner.
         </p>
         <p>
          Over the last ten years they have developed concepts and
realised projects from installations to large-scale interiors,
architecture and urban interventions in which these principles
are integrated. They are currently working on a disruptive
solution for healthcare housing, a nature-based pavilion for the
Floriade Expo, several museum conversions, new retail
formulas and a radical concept for a building as a cluster of
services.
         </p>
         <p>
          Over the last decade their work has gained worldwide
appreciation through numerous publications, exhibitions and
awards.
