       The modern loyalty and discount market is looking like a global mobile communications ecosystem having no automatic roaming.
      </h2>
      <p>
       All brands and retailers offer closed-in programs that are absolutely incompatible with each other. Consumer is no longer able to master such extensive offer even at the regional level. Coalition programs, aimed to minimize this friction by unifying of user interface and widening loyalty borders, cope with this role only in part. Despite the coalition programs boom in recent years and popularity of such business model, coalitions have not been able to carry out the task of loyalty decentralization and simplifying access to a variety of offers from different brands and retail networks.
            Modern loyalty and reward programs fail to answer consumer needs due to numerous difficulties of claiming rewards in time, complex collecting rules, high density of program offers and many other frictions. Thus many consumers are abandoning their subscriptions without redeeming their bonus savings.
            This has been clearly shown by the following recent study:
       <a class="inline-link" href="http://info.bondbrandloyalty.com/2017-loyalty-report" style="display: inline" target="_blank">
        Bond Brand Loyalty Report â2017 called Â«THE BATTLE FOR LOVE &amp; LOYALTYÂ» (in collaboration with VISA)
       </a>
       stating âMEMBERSHIPS ARE UP, WHILE MEMBER ENGAGEMENT IS AT CAPACITYâ.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, the situation is even worse, since their figures show slight decline instead of stagnation. The number of active memberships have declined from the average 7.8 active memberships per user out of 10,9 (72%) in 2014 down to 6.7 active memberships out of 14.3 (just 47%) in 2017.
      </p>
      <p>
       âSince our 2014 study, the average number of Program memberships per American consumer has increased steadily from under 11 Programs to over 14. Meanwhile, the number of Programs in which Members are active, meaning they have earned or burned Program benefits or rewards, is virtually unchanged at just under 6.7 (47%). This suggests that Americans are willing to enroll in additional Programs, yet their capacity to engage has reached a threshold.ââââconcludes the report.
      </p>
      <p>
       The customer complication is aggravated by the fact that earned points, miles or "cash" are not liquid inside the existing ecosystem consisting of numerous centralized loyalty and reward programs. The friction is also significant for businesses issuing points, miles and other rewarding tokens. While businesses are striving to retain their customers, they are simultaneously destroying customer loyalty by compulsory withdrawing of bonus savings in order to respect financial requirements relating to issuance of deferred liabilities.
      </p>
      <aside>
       Another headache is the churn of consumers. Every business targeting customer retention makes its unique offer with a full set of loyalty cards, mobile applications, mailings and social network promotions but consumers are quickly disappointed since they want to subscribe just one user-friendly program where they can access all available opportunities and earn rewards in reliable environment preventing from any type of expropriation of their loyalty savings.
      </aside>
      <h2 style="text-align: justify;">
       LIQUID BONUS IS THE NEW ADDED-VALUE ROAMING SERVICE FOR CENTRALIZED LOYALTY AND DISCOUNT PROGRAMS
      </h2>
      <h2 style="text-align: justify;">
       In just a few years the world of rewards will be radically changed, and those who
            will catch an opportunity to become own the main tokenized instrument in this new
            global world will not remain disappointed!
      </h2>
      <h2 style="text-align: justify;">
       Now you have a
       <a class="inline-link inline-link--offering" href="#">
        unique opportunity
       </a>
       to be involved in the foundation of a new global loyalty ecosystem, driven by buyers, rather than by retail networks and loyalty alliances. Only the modern customer-oriented approach can lead the market to a new horizon in terms of attractiveness, usability and gross turnover.

       LIQUID BONUS MEDIUM ACTS AS A HUB CONNECTING CONSUMERS WITH RETAILERS AND BRANDS BY ANSWERING THEIR URGENT NEEDS FOR IMPROVED COMMUNICATION, OPTIMIZATION OF OFFERING AND ADVANCED GEO TARGETING DRIVEN BY LBS .
      </h2>
      <p>
       Using Blockchain technology, the Liquid Bonus Medium eliminates most frictions preventing instant use of rewards and other customer benefits by introducing the interoperable Liquid Bonus (LiBO) reward tokens in combination with online marketplace having location-based (LBS) capability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being used as a single unified rewarding mean inside the decentralized borderless international environment, Liquid Bonus tokens shall play a role of the high-grade fuel for the next generation global loyalty and rewards ecosystem.
      </p>
      <h2>
       Â«3Data sourcingÂ» TECHNIQUE
      </h2>
      <p>
       The Liquid Bonus ecosystem will accept, consolidate and present in an optimized form the following geo targeted data:
      </p>
      <ul class="marker-list">
       <li>
        <span class="inline-marker">
         OFFERS FROM BRANDS AND SUPPLIERS
        </span>
        - scheduled promotions and daily offers from manufacturers and suppliers. Recently, brands are increasingly active in the establishing direct contacts with consumers, so this communication channel is seen as no less important than retail;
       </li>
       <li>
        <span class="inline-marker">
         OFFERS FROM SHOPS AND RETAIL NETWORKS
        </span>
        - promotion campaigns and daily offers of single shops and retail networks are facing constant communication need for efficient delivery of their actual proposals to the target audience. We consider the notion of "target audience" not just as a usual classification of buyers, but rather as their current location. Indeed, targeting location to a country or city canât answer the actual consumer needs due to the complex logistics in urban areas. Most potential buyers will likely reject to cross a city for catching some discounts. The only exception is seasonal sales with significant discounts but the majority of daily purchases made in the "here and now" mode. That is, in order to achieve higher effectiveness of sales promotions, retailer should be capable of establishing communication channel not just with visitors, but also with all potential buyers located close enough to be hooked by the offer. The era of developed information technologies and mobile communications makes it possible to replace all barkers screaming about local sale with an automated means of Liquid Bonus aggregating loyalty and discount offers and distributing related information to consumers located in the immediate vicinity of the point of sale.
       </li>
       <li>
        <span class="inline-marker">
         CONSUMER FEEDBACKS
        </span>
        - the main focus here is on aggregating information from consumers, primarily in the form of cash-desk receipts, uploaded into the system through the Liquid Bonus wallet application. In addition to the social component (Â«being happy with a good daily deal, donât hesitate helping others to get it and next time they will help youÂ»), as an incentive for submitting receipt to the Liquid Bonus medium, the LiBO token Â«thank you dropÂ» shall be automatically transferred from the system to the consumerâs wallet.

      <p>
       Every loyalty program or coalition is interested in growing customer base and accelerated leaching of internal points to reduce deferred liabilities. In order to achieve the highest level of efficiency, Liquid Bonus Medium will simultaneously utilize the following set of loyalty system incentives:

        <span class="inline-marker">

        the possibility of withdrawing expired miles and points from the programâs economic context instead of the unpopular expropriation by expiration;

       <li>
        <span class="inline-marker">
         Expand the customer base:

      </ul>

       The business component of the Liquid Bonus core has the following constituents:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <span class="inline-marker">
         Â«BIGGER DATAÂ»
        </span>
        Business is interested in expanding the scope of the collected customer data, but is usually limited by its retail network. After connecting to the Liquid Bonus system, the business gets the ability to match the anonymous Liquid Bonus wallet address with the known customer having personal data and history integrated to retailerâs loyalty program.  Therefore retailer gets access to customer receipts from other stores, which were collected and stored in the Liquid Bonus Medium;
       </li>
       <li>
        <span class="inline-marker">
         Â«COMMUNICATION CHANNELÂ»
        </span>
        Business is interested in optimization of its sales campaigns. Being part of the Liquid Bonus ecosystem, retailer shall get an additional communication channel to consumers advanced with location-based service thus gaining an increased efficiency of communications;
       </li>
       <li>
        <span class="inline-marker">
         Â«EXPANSION OF THE CUSTOMER BASEÂ»
        </span>
        Business is always interested in attracting new customers. Being part of the Liquid Bonus ecosystem, retailers will get an opportunity to establish relationships with both - potential buyers from local region and tourists / visitors. This possibility is especially relevant for the regions with a large tourist flow and high business activity.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <aside>
       The usual process of retailersâ interaction with consumers provides the ability to track consumer shopping carts and purchasing frequency just for the loyalty program subscribers. The Blockchain-based decentralized Liquid Bonus ecosystem erases all boundaries by allowing retailers to look into their customersâ receipts issued outside of the home retail network.
      </aside>
      <p>
       Being designed as a community of consumers interested in optimizing their shopping basket by means of more efficient use of loyalty programs and daily deal offerings, the decentralized Liquid Bonus ecosystem becomes a true global aggregator of information about purchases by means of receipt data consolidation &amp; processing. Purchases in various retail chains and stores are registered by the involved buyers on a daily basis. It is essential that accumulated receipt information is linked just to the anonymous Liquid Bonus wallet address and becomes available to all participants accepting and issuing Liquid Bonus tokens having no violation of personal confidentiality principle.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, retailers participating in the Liquid Bonus Medium through the installation of the Loyalty Node (in fact, this node is the Liquid Bonus Blockchain auditor), in addition to the possibility of exchanging their internal loyalty points to Liquid Bonus tokens and back, shall gain a unique opportunity to unambiguously link the buyer's personal data (internal data of the loyalty program) with the anonymous Liquid Bonus wallet address thereby expanding the context of interaction with the consumer from the local retail level limited by loyalty program to the true global level, having no geographical or business limitations.

       Expensive to roll-out and operate, using a limited time / limited coverage, non-convertible utilities enabling very narrow possibilities for retail customers, built as self-sufficient and isolated from each other thus making redemption process tricky and requiring special customerâs attention, conventional loyalty programs and coalitions keep facing serious obstacles on their way to a truly global coverage and ubiquitous frictionless use.
      </aside>
      <p>
       According to the COLLOQUYâs biennial report on the scope of U.S. customer rewards programs "American households hold memberships in 29 loyalty programs spread among the retail, financial services, travel and various other economic sectors, but are active in just 12 of them. The corresponding household membership figures in the 2013 census were 22 and nine."

        Attention!
       </span>
       A LiqBoÂ® Token is NOT yet another stuff based on ETH.
            We shall introduce and launch the new generation of Blockchain loyalty infrastructure with appropriate LiqBo utility tokens used for global international
            loyalty and rewards. If you sign and donate today, your pool of temporary ERC tokens will be later incapsulated into the global Loyalty Media infrastructure
            as a 'global loyalty token' used for numerous interoperable loyalty and reward programs around the world.
       <span class="inline-marker">
        Join us today to help us generating global loyalty and reward turnover tomorrow!
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to unify the application and erase the circulation boundaries for reward points, miles and other proprietary utilities, the interoperable Liquid BonusÂ® or LiqBoÂ® Token has been introduced. LiqBoÂ® Token is the utility token aimed for abstracting from (sometimes replacing of) points, stamps, miles and other valued legacy bonus points. Thus every customer shall be able to get LiqBoÂ® Tokens as reward in the context of any existing loyalty program or even from a standalone shop and exchange them for discounts at any point of sale that is ready to accept LiqBoÂ® Tokens.
      </p>
      <aside>
       Thanks to its core Blockchain infrastructure, the Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty Aggregation Medium with its interoperable LiqBoÂ® Token shall give a new breath to the global loyalty business model thus bringing loyalty programsâ penetration to a new high level.
      </aside>
      <p class="article-image">
       <img src="images/liqbo.gif"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       If we examine the loyalty programsâ attractiveness for the customers by classifying them according to program design and redemption options, then the absolute leadership shall be given to coalition loyalty programs having cash back or direct rebate options available for consumers. In addition to it, the special buyersâ attention is always paid to a gift option, getting earnings at someone's store and redemption at another's and other bonus circulation options.
      </p>
      <aside>
       In addition to it, we consider as a very important indicator and clear landmark the fact that American Airlines' report in 2006 stated that the airline earned more from selling Advantage miles to its partners, like Citibank, than it did selling airline tickets. Thus, the willingness for the turnover of bonuses was confirmed in practice more than 10 years ago!
      </aside>
      <p>
       The Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty Aggregation Medium directly addresses this by sharing of the adopted economy model of conventional loyalty programs while providing an economic incentive that allows users to collect their LiqBoÂ® Tokens from different loyalty market players and easily âmonetizeâ them by rewarding at their next purchase elsewhere. Moreover, acquirers and(or) owners of the LiqBoÂ® Tokens not only have an opportunity to get and reward them at any time, but also in the event of a long non-use of accumulated stake, they may increase their "bonus savings" due to the market growth of the LiqBoÂ® Tokenâs value. So we hope that in the near future collected bonus points and miles will not be considered as a limited-usage expiring tools but rather as a liquid and profitable assets.

         We have discovered a number of essential drawbacks of almost every loyalty program such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          - expensive for roll-up and operation;
         </li>
         <li>
          - inability to consolidate and use purchasing data and customer preferences from outside of âhomeâ retail network;
         </li>
         <li>
          - use of a limited time / limited coverage, non-refundable utilities enabling very narrow possibilities for retail customers;
         </li>
         <li>
          - self-sufficiency and isolation of programs from each other thus making redemption process tricky and requiring special attention;
         </li>
         <li>
          - absence of unified mobile application with enhanced geo targeted offer aggregating multiple loyalty and âdaily dealâ offerings;
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         As a consequence, according to 2011 COLLOQUY Loyalty Census study, âOut of roughly $48 billion worth of perceived value in reward points and miles American businesses issue annually, at least one- third, representing $16 billion in value, goes unredeemed by consumersâ so there is tremendous opportunity for improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
         According to the Allied Market Research, the global loyalty management market was valued at $1,931 million in 2016, and is projected to reach $6,955 million by 2023
        </p>
        <p>
         Estimating the overall turnover of loyalty programs in conditional US dollars, we are based on the figure of about $80 billion in 2017 and at least $230 billion by 2023. Assessing the market share of about 1% in 5 years, we assume about $2,5 billion turnover through the Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty Aggregation Medium.
        </p>
        <p>
         Based on several fundamental improvements such as the possibility to achieve liquidity of bonus points, integrated marketplace accumulating customer data with enhanced geo targeting (thanks to the built-in mobile Location-Based Service (LBS)), unlimited accumulation of bonuses with sell and exchange capabilities and automated shopping basket optimization by cost, the combination of Liquid Bonus wallet and Blockchain shall become a key loyalty application in the near future.
        </p>
        <p>
         Taking into account the annually unredeemed $16 billion in US alone, our estimation of $2,5 billion annual turnover is rather pessimistic than realistic.

         As a Loyalty Provider, why should I take part in creation and operation of another system, if I can proceed with conversion using national currency?
        </a>
       </h2>
       <div class="qa__item-content">
        <p>
         This is a very reasonable question. The answer stands behind the economy model. The whole Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty Aggregation Medium is based on Blockchain technology where every single loyalty provider can decide if this time operational margin is mainly targeted &amp; transaction fee must be set to its maximum value, or it may be set to a lower value or even zeroed for optimized offering. For the case when traditional banking settlement is applied for either conversion of bonus points to a national currency or an inter-loyalty clearance (conversion from one loyalty medium to another), any loyalty provider or consumer will have to cover much more expensive and mandatory transaction fee set by a 3d Party (bank or exchange) thus remaining out of loyalty providerâs control and making no impact on loyalty providersâ revenue growth.
        </p>
        <p>
         The second important thing is that every loyalty provider introducing own Loyalty Node to the Liquid Bonus system, in addition to the possibility of exchanging the internal loyalty points into Liquid Bonus tokens and back, shall gain a unique opportunity to unambiguously link the buyer's personal data (internal data of the loyalty program) with the anonymous Liquid Bonus wallet address thereby expanding the consumer interaction context from the local retail level, limited by a loyalty program to the global level, having no geographical or business boundaries.

        <p>
         Even though we have already been approaching retail community since late 2017 and, after numerous publications and presentations during retail conferences in Russia, we are faced no criticism of our approach, we believe that it may face some friction in other countries.
        </p>
        <p>
         Taking into account the great potential of the Blockchain technology together with history of distributed ledger adoption by financial markets, we are sure that after a short period of time, vendors, retail networks, loyalty programs and coalitions will certainly discover numerous benefits from using Liquid Bonus together with its new opportunities for further development.
        </p>
        <p>
         In our opinion, such opportunities as
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          - collecting customer shopping data and preferences outside of the home retail network;
         </li>
         <li>
          - strengthening customer loyalty by stopping of annual expropriation of accumulated points and miles;
         </li>
         <li>
          - customer base expansion though approaching tourists and visitors;
         </li>
         <li>
          - optimization of promotional advertising by precise geo targeting based on mobile Location-based Service (LBS);
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         will definitely speed up the process of getting used to this new approach and related technological solution.

         This is probably a good solution for particular local market. Personally I do not see how it is possible to change something on the long-established and mature loyalty market in my country.
        </a>
       </h2>
       <div class="qa__item-content">
        <p>
         The point is that this solution is aimed for the global market. No country is an exception, but all are special cases since loyalty scenarios are always being created based on regional specificity. We understand the US market is very different from the European one and Asia is a completely different case, but the fact is that loyalty market is very fragmented due to the lots of programs and regional limitations. As a matter of fact, many loyalty programs are ignored over time even by their checked-in customers since they simply fail to find the right loyalty card or credentials at the right time... and this is not yet a story about frequent travelers who rarely re-use their loyalty subscription abroad even with large international partnership loyalty projects. The major exception, perhaps, are airline alliances which, in turn, fail to answer their customersâ demand every time they would like to.
        </p>
        <p>
         With this project, we intend to launch something like a "Bitcoin for loyalty". This is an interoperable utility token for loyalty called Liquid BonusÂ® or LiqBoÂ® which shall not depend on any existing loyalty program or coalition, have no regional influence and do not pretend for re-execution of loyalty business scenario(s). This is just a crypto-token aimed for conversion of âloyalty anythingâ into âanything loyaltyâ, for example, frequent flier miles into retail points and vice versa...
        </p>
        <p>
         We understand that very likely large loyalty market players will not take this idea at the beginning, but having hundreds of millions of interested consumers and a large number of small shops and market players who have not yet been ready to feed a million bucks into the IBM's money box to put themselves on a cool loyalty track, we feel that 'critical mass' can be reached in about three to five years of hard work which we intend to do.

         I see you have started this project less than one year ago but ICO is full of scam now. Why should I prefer your project from others and why do you think you will be able to build and launch such a complex system as you claim it?
        </a>
       </h2>
       <div class="qa__item-content">
        <p>
         First of all I have to mention that our team is leaded by two co-founders, each having a unique technical background, extensive innovation portfolio which is repeatedly confirmed by publications, patented inventions and successful complex IT projects. Secondly, we are backed by Trafficland Limited, the successful software house and B2B service provider with the proven track record of commercial rollouts including mobile payment infrastructure, location- based service (LBS) solution, mobile media multicasting platform and unique over-the-air (U)SIM card management platform allowing to carry-out mission critical operations like online swapping of mobile subscribersâ IMSI in a mass- operation mode.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thirdly, few months ago we have successfully completed the proof-of-concept (PoC) and passed laboratory tests for confirming the possibility of ensuring the blockchain performance capability, which can meet retailersâ requirements for the speed of transactions. Unfortunately, Ethereum with its ERC20 tokens is not able to process Liquid Bonus transactions within 2-4 seconds, as it is required by retailers. Therefore, we are based on the alternative blockchain solution optimized for highest performance. Our press release on the results is published here below. Currently, we continue working on integrated solution, which shall be used to conduct pilot operation of the Liquid Bonus ecosystem with at least 2-3 retailers participating in it. In parallel, we are developing a mobile Liquid Bonus wallet, which shall support a number of additional functions related to the global marketplace aggregating loyalty and discount offers internationally. Unfortunately, our current team and available budget do not allow us to develop software versions for Android and iOS simultaneously. Nevertheless, the mobile application for Android, being under development and scheduled to May 2018, shall allow a full-fledged pilot operation of the Liquid Bonus Medium beta in the very near future.
        </p>
        <p>
         And finally, we have a comprehensive international team of supporters and advisors who have already spent their time to review our project documentation and gave us their positive feedback together with valuable remarks.

         Why have you set the soft cap and what it is based on?
        </a>
       </h2>
       <div class="qa__item-content">
        <p>
         Soft Cap is established on the basis of our vision concerning the cost of developing and testing of the core system and mobile wallet with a minimum functionality allowing us to integrate 2-3 Loyalty Nodes belonging to early adopters from retail community and carry out pilot operation. If we will fail to accumulate an appropriate funding during this ICO, it may be extended or interrupted depending on visible ICO perspectives and (or) alternative funding options which may appear to that date.
        </p>
        <p>
         In case of insufficient funding raised through ICO, we reserve the right to cancel the issuance of ERC20 tokens thus the entire volume of LiBO tokens shall be issued inside the Liquid Bonus Blockchain. In the latter case, we will discuss with every contributor and accept individual decision whether to return funds or distribute Liquid Bonus tokens which will be incompatible with the ERC20 format.
        </p>
        <p>
         Considering that software development has been started in 2017, the beta version will be launched in 2018 in either case.

       </h2>
       <div class="qa__item-content">
        <p>
         Hard Cap â this is the funding volume that we believe at the current stage of the project, can be reasonably spent not just for a complete system development and rollout, but also for a marketing campaign promoting the Liquid Bonus ecosystem to the global market and for creating representative offices on all continents in order to ensure local presence, support and promotion in accordance with local rules and traditions.

         I fail to understand the distribution process of LiBO tokens well. Now you say you issue about 50% of the total volume and, despite the fact that you are building your own blockchain, you issue ERC20 tokens.. so why? And what will happen to the second part of the volume?
        </a>
       </h2>
       <div class="qa__item-content">
        <p>
         All right, we have decided to accumulate funding in ETH and to issue ERC20 tokens for all investors taking part in this ICO. Indeed, ERC20 is the number one investment instrument well-supported by the majority of crypto exchanges. Honestly, we have no technical need for ERC20 since Liquid Bonus blockchain is not compatible with it. Unlike many other ICOs, we are the true infrastructure project which will have its own blockchain with corresponding utility token. Therefore, we do not intend to burn unissued ERC20 tokens after the ICO since huge volume of LiBO tokens will be needed for system operation. The total volume shall remain intact so the less ERC20 tokens distributed during this ICO â the more tokens shall appear inside the Liquid Bonus blockchain. And in case of the ICO failure, there is a possibility that all token volume will be issued inside the Liquid Bonus blockchain thus no ERC20 Liquid Bonus tokens will be in circulation.

       FINSTICK Innovations reduces the cost of common loyalty systems through Blockchain-driven Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty Aggregation Medium
      </h1>
     </header>
     <p>
      FINSTICK Innovations have successfully completed a Proof of Concept (PoC) based on the Blockchain driven Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty Aggregation Medium.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty Aggregation Medium eliminates most problems associated with isolated, self-sufficient loyalty programs and, as a consequence, the low consumer demand for related services.
     </p>
     <p>
      The average consumer may well be registered in a dozen loyalty programs, but actively uses only 2-4 of them.  The Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty Aggregation Medium solves this issue by sharing the conventional economic model of traditional loyalty programs with the additional incentive of accumulating Liquid BonusÂ® (LiqBoÂ®) tokens.  These can be âmonetizedâ or exchanged for a discount in the traditional way at participating merchants.
     </p>
     <p>
      "By creating and implementing the Liquid BonusÂ® Medium, we aim to reduce significantly the cost of integrating common loyalty systemsâ, said Julius B. Kuznetsov, founder and CEO of FINSTICK Innovations "In addition, we shall provide much higher throughput and performance than competing public Blockchain-based solutions."
     </p>
     <!-- <p>The Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty Aggregation Medium (<a href="http://www.liqbo.com/" class="inline-link">www.liqbo.com</a>) is designed to eliminate most of problems associated with self-sufficiency, closeness and isolation of loyalty programs and, as a consequence, low consumersâ demand for related services. Indeed, being registered in a dozen of loyalty programs, the average customer actively uses just 2-4 of them. The Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty Aggregation Medium solves this issue by sharing the conventional economic model of traditional loyalty programs with an additional incentive that customers gain along with the ability to accumulate Liquid BonusÂ® or LiqBoÂ® tokens. By getting LiqBoÂ® tokens as a reward and (or) by converting them from miles and points of various loyalty market players, consumers can easily "monetize" them later by obtaining a discount in exchange to LiqBoÂ® tokens or by reverse conversion to a proprietary mean of discount at the next purchase in another place.</p>
        <p>"In the process of creating and implementing of the Liquid BonusÂ® Medium, we are striving to achieve much lower cost than today's existing loyalty solution providers can offer for integration of common loyalty systemsâ, said Julius Kuznetsov, founder and CEO of FINSTICK Innovations "In addition to it, we shall provide much higher throughput and performance than competing public Blockchain â based solutions can do."</p> -->

       Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty, the global, interoperable, loyalty blockchain platform, launches its Early Bird Crowd-Sale
      </h1>
     </header>
     <article>
      The Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty is announcing its first Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in order to grow and develop its business worldwide.
     </article>
     <p>
      MOSCOW, RUSSIA, January 25, 2018 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Moscow, 25 January 2018 - The Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty is a global business targeting the loyalty and discount industry, eliminating country borders to serve retail customers around the world. With a successful proof-of-concept already in place and a number of essential partnerships underway, Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty is announcing its first Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in order to grow and develop its business worldwide. This Early Bird Program expires on February 18, 2018.
     </p>
     <p>
      Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty
     </p>
     <p>
      The Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty is a global, decentralized intermediary working to facilitate existing loyalty and discount programs, by:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       - Overcoming the growing pains caused by the inability for customers to manage effectively more than 5-7 loyalty subscriptions;
      </li>
      <li>
       - Developing a smart way to get rid of excessive liability caused from expiring proprietary loyalty points by converting them into interoperable LiqBoÂ® tokens;
      </li>
      <li>
       - Uniting loyalty and reward programs into a distributed, secure and unified medium;
      </li>
      <li>
       - Allowing instant transfers of proprietary bonus points to interoperable LiqBoÂ® tokens, and back, for an optional loyalty providers' conversion fee;
      </li>
      <li>
       - Enforcing strict anonymity of all loyalty providers' data;
      </li>
      <li>
       - Providing the highest level of security to protect transactions and data;
      </li>
      <li>
       - Providing a common user-friendly mobile interface for every participating loyalty program.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      All of these valuable features have been combined in one system, using the modern blockchain approach, while responding to retailerâs demands for fast transaction throughput. The use of state-of-the-art âSIDECHAIN with 2-WAY PEGâ implementation means that the Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty solution is a main contender for becoming the loyalty application of the future.
     </p>
     <p>
      The unique Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty tool for end-users fulfills all major social and reward needs of retail customers. With its comprehensive functionality and user-friendly mobile interface, it presents valuable advantages over other loyalty applications for retail users.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Early Bird Program is a unique opportunity for those excited by this project and willing to support its rapid development. Early Bird Contributors in the crowd-sale will benefit from the exclusive option of issuing fixed discount coupons to their followers thus increasing their Liquid Bonus stakes until the end of the ICO. These favorable conditions are limited to this offer which ends on February 18, 2018. Following this, our loyalty and discount conditions for acquiring interoperable LiqBoÂ® tokens will downgrade in subsequent stages of the ICO.
     </p>
     <p>
      "All raised funds will go to the development of the best in class blockchain-based, decentralized, intermediary ecosystem for loyalty, aimed at serving retail customers all over the worldâ, said Julius Kuznetsov, founder and CEO of
      <a class="inline-link" href="//www.finstick.net/">
       FINSTICK Innovations LLC
      </a>
      , the initiator of the Liquid Bonus Loyalty project. "The Liquid Bonus Loyalty system will not be owned by FINSTICK Innovations or by any other Party. Instead, it will be operated based on consensus of participating brands and retailers forming a unique, global, loyalty infrastructure based on distributed ledgerâ.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to the latest loyalty report, provided by Bond Brand Loyalty in collaboration with VISA, "Loyalty memberships are up while member engagement is at capacity." They add, "The cumulative points liability for all U.S. Programs is estimated to be valued at roughly $100 billion." This shows a tremendous market potential which Liquid Bonus Loyalty aims to address with its original blockchain solution answering retailers' demand for fast transactions.

       Using Blockchain technology for customer loyalty programs
      </h1>
      <h2 style="margin-bottom: 30px">
       (Julius B. Kuznetsov, published by promdevelop.ru)

     <p>
      Having got out into a shopping mall together with my big family, I did not expect that this walk would be the beginning of my new project... Standing at the cash-desk with a heap of clothes for our children and ourselves:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       - Do you have our loyalty card?
      </li>
      <li>
       I (instantly):
      </li>
      <li>
       - No!
      </li>
      <li>
       My wife:
      </li>
      <li>
       - Yes, wait a second, I'll have a quick look... she begins to sort through a stack looking like a deck of playing cards
      </li>
      <li>
       - I canât findâ¦ how does it look like? What color?
      </li>
      <li>
       Saleswoman:
      </li>
      <li>
       - I canât say for sure, we have issued different ones, it seems the latest has had a blue tones..
      </li>
      <li>
       A line behind us begins the murmur of waiting
      </li>
      <li>
       - No, regret, I canât find, oh, what a pity!
      </li>
      <li>
       - Hey, thereâs no problem, let's issue one more for free and you can use it right away saving new points!
      </li>
      <li>
       Dissatisfied murmur behind my back is being intensified, I focus my thoughts on our children who have been left to themselves for a long time in a children's corner with slides and other near-sport entertainments..
      </li>
      <li>
       - No !
      </li>
      <li>
       I say firmly,
      </li>
      <li>
       - Do not even try to do anything else, than process our purchases and we shall leave on other business asap! No additional formalities, please!
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      This is a common scene of our daily life, no fiction at all. This was exactly the moment when Iâve asked myself: "How much longer can this be continued!?" And I thought about how to make the buying process easier and more comfortable for everyone.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loyalty and discount programs have been invented earlier than one century ago. Once upon a time, buyers were given metal tokens and stamps issued by a separate store. Those days, people lived a settled way and moved, at best, on horses, going out according to modern standards not on a travel, but rather on a short walk. Lots of water has flowed under the bridge since that time, but the need
          to stimulate sales, and even better, to bind all customers to a store has remained. And, strangely enough, the methods have not been undergoing valuable changes. Every single store or retail chain strives to do this for itself and allocates a huge budget on developing of its own loyalty and discount program, thus making changes to IT system and cash desks, issuing plastic cards and distributing them among buyers.  But, apparently, they all forget that such system works frictionless only in case no one else doing the same thing but becomes a real nightmare for buyers, as soon as every store introduces yet another loyalty program... or almost everyone, because not everyone has enough money to setup and launch so complex and expensive system.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Liquid Bonus - the idea of making business that optimizes loyalty programs.
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The idea of Liquid Bonus (LiqBo), which helps to accumulate and keep your points, miles and other benefits provided by retail networks, shops and airlines, has instantly appeared, but I had to spend much time for thinking and consulting with my friends to find a suitable solution, which would not become yet another loyalty partnership or a coalition having limited number of participants. You can come up with a new elegant solution that may bring success and money, but it will not change the current situation. This time my goal was quite away from the common approach of a businessman and innovator.
     </p>
     <p>
      In order for the "Liquid Bonus" to become really interesting to buyers and retailers, it should be truly global, not just working with major sellers, but also be easily accepted in many countries of the world. This tool should not interfere with the process established by every single store, network or loyalty coalition and prevent from any kind of disclosure of customersâ data accumulated in a loyalty program of an individual retail network, partnership or coalition. At the same time, I thought, Liquid Bonus should provide a trustful environment for all participants, even though theyâre direct competitors and do not trust each other at all.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       How can we improve the loyalty programsâ efficiency by means of blockchain?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      And voila! I came to the conclusion that the best approach for solving the problem is the blockchain technology with a tool similar to Bitcoin, which is not used for making payments and money transfers between people, but for redistributing and using the accumulated bonus points through non-trusted environment and in an optimized manner. Who would refuse an opportunity to collect points and discounts accumulated in a mother country and take them away for holidays benefitting from local offerings abroad? And surely, in case of having unused points at the end of the month, to bring them back home and execute during a forthcoming local saleâ¦
     </p>
     <p>
      Being involved in Loyalty Aggregation Medium, retail chains, shops and interested brands will become decision-making participants of the interoperable system thus making decisions about its operation and further development on the basis of consensus, as it happens in the world of crypto-currencies. Each participant with a native loyalty program will continue to operate it in its common mode. Any possibility of confidential information disclosure will be excluded. Every participant of the open Loyalty Aggregation Medium shall be able to track which retailer(s) were targeted after converting loyalty points to LiqBo thus making it possible to better evaluate and show the most suitable partner for a deeper loyalty cooperation in the future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       And finally, a few words to retailers and loyalty coalitions.
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Instead of âburning-outâ bonus points and miles in order to decrease the total level of liabilities arising from constant issuance process, let your customers converting them into LiqBo tokens. You will not only get rid of the excess of customersâ obligations elegantly, but will gain additional option of assigning a commission for such operation. Or you can allow your customers to withdraw their surplus of accumulated points for free. But the point is not even there. The main thing is that your grateful customers will return back to you for convenient service and new opportunitiesâ¦ and new customers will come along with them.
     </p>
     <p>
      Be the first and success will be on your side!
     </p>

       IT-results of 2017: three main events
      </h1>
      <h2 style="margin-bottom: 30px">
       (blitz interview to the CHIP Magazine, Russian edition)

      <strong>
       BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY
      </strong>
      is an absolute leader.
     </p>
     <p>
      From my point of view the most significant event of the year is the mass recognition and adoption of the open registries (Blockchain) technology. It is very essential that despite Bitcoin phenomenon claims to be the most significant IT event of 2017, it is just a special case of Blockchain technology along with property rights registries (real estate, stocks, etc.) and many other applications. Therefore, I put Blockchain in the title and Bitcoin, even though it is being part of the first place, is mentioned in the description. Indeed, Bitcoin is essential for fintech industry, the economy and banking sector, but the influence of the core Blockchain technology is spread to the most of everything associated with IT.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       THE NEW CUSTOMERSâ DATA PROCESSING POLICIES, KYC
      </strong>
      and numerous anti- money laundering and anti- terrorism regulations, new requirements for the collection, storage and transfer of user data, the end of a "pure freedom of Internet content".. all this have its fundamental impact on IT and near-IT business. Moreover, it has started changing - the way and how users get services and content in Russia and around the world. A sharp change of these "rules" in 2017 will have a lasting impact to the further evolution of the entire IT industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       MASS INTRODUCTION OF BIG DATA and ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
      </strong>
      are all IT 'chips' that have changed our life once and forever. In 2017 no one is surprised by cases like a story of âHow Target Figured Out A Teen Girl Was Pregnant Before Her Father Didâ. And the artificial intelligence has launched its undisguised offensive in the labor market, beginning to squeeze out lower-level bank employees, lawyers and some other categories of workers.

       NO GHOSTS or how scam can be identified at the early stage of ICO projects?
      </h1>
      <h2 style="margin-bottom: 30px">
       (Julius B. Kuznetsov, published by promdevelop.ru)
      </h2>
     </header>
     <p>
      Dozens or even hundreds of ICO initiatives are turning into dust right before our eyes. Bitcoin is febrile, the rest of the crypto-currencies too. Most of us understand that global crypto-story features of a big bubble, others loudly share this impression. Fans of puzzles are in vain to find answers to the questions âAnd yet, why did Bitcoin suddenly have become so desired for everyone? Where is useful function?â And against this background, millions of investors continue to enter the contradictory crypto assets.
     </p>
     <p>
      Even though you would decide to invest just few bucks into an ICO project, you shall likely think about whether it will bring you some dividends or not. Every investor dreams of making big and quick money, but is it worth every time?
     </p>
     <p>
      Letâs try to figure out together some of ICO projectsâ nuances.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Large or even huge ICO budget.
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Let us recall the last yearâs parable about monkeys, skillfully housed to a village. This story have turned to be, perhaps, a â1 hit story among people who invested in crypto, or thinking about it. I wonder why those peasants so easily paid for a dead horse? But everything is so simple â their focus has been completely shifted to profit, but no one even tried to think about the product bringing dividends at the end of the day, how it works and why this product is absolutely needed by everyone?
     </p>
     <p>
      It would seem that in case ICO project has already managed to attract a valuable investment not only to fulfill the basic intended purpose, but also for an extensive marketing and advertising campaign, this can serve as a reliable confirmation of its consistency. Unfortunately, in the real world this sometimes turns out to be the opposite.
     </p>
     <p>
      By avoiding focusing on hype and paying better attention to the cause and effect relationships, it would not be so difficult to understand the reality to draw the right conclusions:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       - Bob has invented a bicycle and went out to getting money for production.
      </li>
      <li>
       - He has attracted good investment So what should he do?
      </li>
      <li>
       - He was about to start bicycle manufacturing and sell them earning wellâ¦ but no, Bob have begun re-investing in famous advisors, contracted the best PR-agency, bought much of leading press space and booked several top conference speaking slots.
      </li>
      <li>
       - At first glance, everything looks right and natural, but when bikes are reminded, the whole picture turns to be different â hey, Bob is no more who he says he is!
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2>
      Lack of innovation.
     </h2>
     <p>
      Many of ICO whitepapers and websites are full of projections about the total demand for issued tokens, ownership benefits and the rapid growth of their value mainly expressed in dollars. However, I can agree just with the last statement on the background of steady capitalization growth and subsequent growing value of crypto-currencies, used as a basis for new tokens. All the rest is a big question. Indeed, why do millions people have to pounce on another derivative of Satoshi Nakamotoâs âcrypto-goldâ? It must be much easier to buy a Bitcoin or another highly demanded crypto-coin and forget about anything else!
     </p>
     <p>
      But in case of real innovation discovered in the proposed ICO solution, then it is likely worth considering it seriously. Maybe this is a new emerging branch of the crypto industry, promising more than generous and, most importantly, long-term dividends?
     </p>
     <h2>
      The clear intention to release another new token based on the same blockchain infrastructure.
     </h2>
     <p>
      Last year, I have followed the development of dozens of ICO projects dedicated to a wide range of economy sectors. Enthusiasts of ICO fund raising have authoritatively promised to use public blockchain (mainly Ethereum one) for absolutely any application including retail and many others requiring high-speed settlement. And, strangely enough, investors were willing to believe this, even though waiting for hours to confirm their crypto-currency donation clearance and paying unreasonable transaction fees for their funds transfer. And finally, the CryptoKitties game, built on the basis of Ethereum blockchain and its smart contracts, became the apogee of such initiatives end of last year by downgrading the entire Ethereum systemâs performance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Very good lesson to learn from!
     </p>
     <h2>
      Lack of support from the associated industry.
     </h2>
     <p>
      You find many ICO articles looking like a promo and published by respectable press. âThereâs nothing special that they are all commercial, now itâs so acceptedâ â you calm yourself by putting a tick in your investorâs evaluation sheet and do not even trying to think about whether there is at least one article or even a word which has been published for its meaning instead of its fiat value.
     </p>
     <p>
      You listen ICO speakers at blockchain conferences and other specialized crypto-eventsâ¦ they are very much appreciated by their crypto-world colleagues and other crypto-currency evangelistsâ¦ and you reasonably mark this ICO by another âplusâ. While you donât even try to figure out whether this recognized by experts from the world of medicine (if ICO is dedicated to medicine), tour-operators and hoteliers (if this presentation was about tourism) or, for example, farmers with restaurateurs if itâs about food. And, most likely, it would be worthwhile showing ICO stuff to the profile experts since beautiful words and slideware may have nothing to do with reality. Sometimes this can only be evaluated and understood by the appropriatery industry professionals.
     </p>
     <h2>
      By the way, few words about beauty
     </h2>
     <p>
      Iâm not inclined to belittle the importance of qualitative show-case design. But, if I would be going to support an innovative blockchain project aimed for social media, Iâd try to figure out why does it opens me a whole universe drawn in a standard landing page and parked in the common ICO domain zone instead of, say,  .TV? And amazingly why do I observe the same universe (a bit differently shaped, of course) on the ICO website dedicated to financial markets? And often many other ICOs have quite similar look. It seems to me those âwow-picturesâ can easily hide the lack of valuable content and, at the same time, let bubble-ICO stay on top of attraction.
     </p>
     <p>
      No, I do not encourage anyone for keeping away from all colorful ICO sites, but it is worth locating and checking for a clearly described innovative idea and the ways of its practical implementation first.
     </p>
     <h2>
      Dust slowly settles â¦ what will be opened to our gaze in 2018?
     </h2>
     <p>
      2017 has become the year of enthusiastic and amateur ICOs and creative ICO swindlers. Some projects have failed to survive by mistakes, others were conceived as scam from the very beginning. 2018 started with numerous dictums about insolvency of ICO as a way of attracting investors. There are many regulation proposals making ICO more transparent by law and even by technology. But whatever happens, the number of innovators and investors will not decrease and, having mastered the next lesson of market spirals, all of them will continue to create amazing and useful solutions â¦ together!

      Starting a business is a big achievement for many entrepreneurs, but maintaining one is the larger challenge. There are many standard challenges that face every business whether they are large or small. It is not easy running a company, especially in a fast-paced, ever-changing business world. Technology advances, new hiring strategies, and now, political changes coming with the new administration, all add to the existing business challenges that entrepreneurs, business owners, and executives have to deal with.
     </p>
     <p>
      Maximizing profits, minimizing expenses and finding talented staff to keep things moving seem to be top challenges for both SMBs and large corporations. We have been interviewing companies from around the world to discover what challenges they are facing in their businesses. We also asked each company to share business advice they would give to a younger version of themselves.
     </p>
     <p>
      Below is our interview with Julius Kuznetsov, Founder and CEO at
      <a href="//finstick.net" target="_blank">
       FINSTICK Innovations LLC
      </a>
      :
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       What does your company do?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      FINSTICK Innovations is a startup in the emerging fintech and blockchain space. We have designed a blockchain-based innovation to unite the fragmented Loyalty market into a single, healthy eco-system. Called LiqBo, it is a utility token that activates dormant customers who are subscribed but donât participate. LiqBo shares the conventional economic model of traditional loyalty programs with the additional incentive of accumulating Liquid Bonus tokens that can be monetized or exchanged for a discount in the traditional way at participating merchants. Based on blockchain, it will be operated based on consensus of participating brands and retailers forming a unique, global, loyalty infrastructure based on distributed ledger. We are headquartered in Moscow, Russia, with an additional virtual office in Amsterdam, Netherlands. We have been in business since 2017.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       What is your role? What do you enjoy most about your role?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Iâm the founder and CEO of FINSTICK Innovations. Creating my own start-up is an exceptional feat for me, after a career working in the technology sector. I enjoy being at the forefront, solving seemingly unsolvable issues, and even more importantly â turning the most unusual ideas into reality for the benefit of our business partners and end-users. I derive great satisfaction from the challenge of creating something new, designed to improve the loyalty market space. Belief in my team and our products gives me the necessary drive to push this forward.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       What are the biggest challenges in your business right now?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      There are two significant challenges to overcome. The first is funding. We have just announced an ICO to raise investment for our solution and have so far managed to raise enough financial resources to go through incorporation and create a proof of concept for LiqBo â our flagship solution for the loyalty industry. We reinvest all funding and consulting profits into R&amp;D but need an infusion of financial support to take Finstick to the next level. The other challenge is linked to regulation. The jury is still out on the legal approaches to the use of cryptographic tokens and blockchains. I am confident that our position as a technical provider will enable us to find our place in the emerging ecosystem.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       If you could go back in time, what business advice would you give to a younger version of yourself?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Great question! I would tell a younger me to be more open-minded and more challenging. I built up a package of experience and wisdom through previous careers and roles, which I felt was important to give myself credibility. In todayâs world, daring to try something new can yield impressive results. I encourage my children not to doubt their talents and to give their projects their all. You never know till you try. Also, customer acceptance is the most important factor in business success. It doesnât matter how great a solution is if your target audience is not open to the idea. New ideas must be customer driven rather than technologically, even if it means reviewing your business plan 10, 20 or even 30 times.

       Liquid Bonus Loyalty for optimizing discount and loyalty programs
      </h1>
      <h2 style="margin-bottom: 30px">
       (English translation, the article was originally published in bitcryptonews.ru)
      </h2>
     </header>
     <p>
      Most of retail marketers believe that loyalty programs representing the most effective way to develop existing customers and attract new ones. Thus companies allocate and spend huge budgets on their deployment and operation. However, legacy loyalty programs repel 70% of consumers at the sign-up stage due to its complexity and duration. Moreover various limitations lead to the fact that sometimes more than half of discount proposals remain inactive.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Liquid Bonus Loyalty project is aimed to solving the existing issues of highly centralized loyalty systems by enabling optional withdrawals of surplus points and miles out from the system instead of their expiration. The built-in capability of exchanging to other bonus points or even currency shall add extra bonus value for consumers. Liquid Bonus shall not just improve the loyalty programsâ effectiveness, but also significantly increase retail customersâ benefits. Hence, buyers will be motivated for long-term cooperation with retailers instead of taking part in particular promotions. On the essence of suggested solution, advantages and future plans for Liquid Bonus, we have discussed with Julius Kuznetsov, the team leader of Liquid Bonus Loyalty project.
     </p>
     <p>
      â
      <strong>
       Why did you initiate the Liquid Bonus project? To whom it is aimed?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      â Decentralization of the discount and loyalty market is long overdue. This was directly or indirectly stated by well-known market players, such as Deloitte, IBM and others. Moreover,
      <span style="text-decoration: underline">
       the search for an optimal decentralized solution is simply inevitable for retailers who have already rested on the physiological consumersâ limit due to the abundance of offered loyalty programs.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the relentless interest in this topic from the business community and the pronounced need of end users who are no longer able to cope with the growing flow of loyalty offers, no one has been able to find an optimal solution for decentralization of the global loyalty market. In our opinion, the problem lies in the lack of blockchain environment capable of providing a high level of performance, which would suit retail applications.
     </p>
     <p>
      The goal of liqbo.com project is to adjust the direction of the discount and loyalty programs development, taking into account trends and approaches described above.
     </p>
     <p>
      â
      <strong>
       Why the project is interesting for you?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      â First of all, it is the implementation of our ideas and views on how the blockchain technology should evolve. We consciously accepted the challenge of creating a high-performance retail system using blockchain technology, because we consider ourselves capable of solving this challenging task.
      <span style="text-decoration: underline">
       Crypto-miles and crypto-points mining or exchange - why not? In our opinion, the loyalty and discount market is no less attractive than financial one, so we are on board!
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      â
      <strong>
       Is it necessary to create a separate crypto currency for these purposes?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      â Cryptocurrency in its common sense is not needed for the implementation of the Liquid Bonus Loyalty project.
      <br/>
      Thanks to our state-of-the-art â2-way pegâ solution, conversion of tokens from one blockchain into another will be introduced. Thus if desired, any participant will either be able to withdraw LiqBo tokens to the crypto-exchange for a frictionless trading or purchasing and transfer stake of LiqBo tokens back to the Liquid Bonus Loyalty system for getting discounts on a retail product or service.
     </p>
     <p>
      â
      <strong>
       What is the development stage of your product? When the product is expected to be released?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      â Despite the fact that a huge amount of work has already been done, we estimate the product as being at the initial stage of its development.
      <br/>
      We plan to launch a trial operation with basic functionality throughout the year. A full-scale commercial launch can take place in late 2019 - early 2020. But with the broad public support of our project, we shall be able to shorten the announced development time and bring it to the market 1,5-2 times earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      â
      <strong>
       Why did you decide to conduct an ICO? Why donât you go on the way of lending or attracting of an investor?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      â This ICO is not an end in itself for us. Unlike other ICOs, we are not going to master a mega-marketing-budget to ensure our ad presence everywhere. At the current stage we would be quite satisfied with the result of the whole ICO, commensurate with the marketing budget of the classic last year's "ICO on a broad scale". We do not consider banking loans as very expensive thus unacceptable, but we are looking for investors and happy with any business angels contacts.
     </p>
     <p>
      -
      <strong>
       How much do you plan to raise during the ICO?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      â We set the minimum threshold (soft-cup) of initial public LiqBo offering at 7,500,000 tokens (500 ETH). And we do not plan to "burn" unallocated tokens. Targeting development rather than speculation, we prefer to gradually distribute them among software developers and other project supporters.
     </p>
     <p>
      -
      <strong>
       How do you see the project life after the ICO?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      â We do not expect any drastic changes after the ICO. The amount of raised funds can only affect the integration speed of our retail Liquid Bonus Loyalty blockchain solution and its pilot operation launch.
     </p>
     <p>
      â
      <strong>
       How much can investor earn on your ICO?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      â It all depends on the purpose for the investor entering the project. If the target is a long-term investment, then it can reach hundreds of percent after the start of commercial operation.
     </p>
     <p>
      For those who are interested in earning on bonuses provided by ICO to their early participants, we have prepared a valuable gift. All investors who entered the project at the Early Bird stage will not only be able to double their LiqBo token stake in the event of reaching ICO soft-cap, but will also be able to issue their personal 20% bonus coupons for new investors getting 10% bonus from the first invested amount using such coupon.
     </p>
     <p>
      â
      <strong>
       Your advice for those who decided to raise funds through ICO in 2018.
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      â In 2018, it is no longer enough making a beautiful website and writing a comprehensive whitepaper to sacrifice investors' liquidity. Therefore, any ICO, assuming a large-scale marketing and advertising cost, will run the risk of net losses in the event that the idea is not supported by a real innovation.

       What will happen to retail in 2018âââPart I
      </h1>
      <h2 style="margin-bottom: 30px">
       (an extract from a series of interviews with retail industry experts, translated from Russian, originally published in www.shopolog.ru)

     </header>
     <p>
      Julius Kuznetsov, Founder and CEO FINSTICK Innovations LLC:
     </p>
     <p>
      In order to imagine what will happen to retail in 2018, first of all we need to consider the main technology trends affecting consumers may be even more than retailers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The rapid development of mobile devices and networks has led to an unprecedented consumer awareness strengthening the status of this party dictating market rules. More and more trading procedures are being transferred from offline to online. Supply chains and consumer product distribution are being adjusted to the dominant online processes too. Retail has actively joined the technological race. From mastering simple IT solutions focused on WEB interface and automating existing business processes (primarily CRM), it has moved to a truly knowledge-intensive sectors of the IT economy, such as big data and the artificial intelligence. Taking into account the universal desire of cost reduction by further improving the concept of self-service in still common offline stores, it is difficult to overestimate the importance of such projects. 2018 shall not make revolution in the development of retail industry. Nevertheless, it will definitely be remembered as a year of adaptation to the new consumer-centric conditions and rules of making retail business.
     </p>
     <p>
      2018 will be the year of
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Showing reduction of the lower and middle level stuff of the offline retailers.
      </strong>
      The steady sales and business automation along with the progressive introduction of artificial intelligence shall inevitably affect the corporate HR policy and lead to a revision of staffing. This year, computers will continue to actively replace humans at customer service and call centers, legal and financial departments, as well as at offline retail outlets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Mass introduction of proactive sales model, which will become the key success factor
      </strong>
      for business development. The leading retail market positions will be successfully taken and consolidated by those players who will be the first to master and use emerging applications based on artificial intelligence and big data. Automated proactive sales will ensure bothâââthe demand forecasting process based on big data analysis and automation of consumer motivation algorithms. Therefore, stories like the one happened to the American teenage girl, whose father found out that she was pregnant later than the retail network offered goods for newborns, shall finally move to the category of everyday in 2018.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Decentralization of loyalty and discount programs.
      </strong>
      According to a perennial market research, the trend of loyalty market saturation has been confirmed last year.
      <a class="inline-link" href="http://info.bondbrandloyalty.com/2017-loyalty-report" style="display: inline" target="_blank">
       Bond Brand Loyalty Report â2017 called Â«THE BATTLE FOR LOVE &amp; LOYALTYÂ» (in collaboration with VISA)
      </a>
      concludes âMEMBERSHIPS ARE UP, WHILE MEMBER ENGAGEMENT IS AT CAPACITYâ. In fact, the situation is even worse, since their figures show slight decline instead of stagnation. The number of active memberships have declined from the average 7.8 active memberships per user out of 10,9 (72%) in 2014 down to 6.7 active memberships out of 14.3 (just 47%) in 2017. âSince our 2014 study, the average number of Program memberships per American consumer has increased steadily from under 11 Programs to over 14. Meanwhile, the number of Programs in which Members are active, meaning they have earned or burned Program benefits or rewards, is virtually unchanged at just under 6.7 (47%). This suggests that Americans are willing to enroll in additional Programs, yet their capacity to engage has reached a threshold.ââââconcludes the report
     </p>
     <p>
      Thus, in order to overcome this negative trend, retailers and loyalty providers will have to start reviewing their loyalty strategy this year. Indeed, all existing centralized loyalty programs are complicated and costly, especially those having inhouse issuance and redemption process in combination with customized compensation scenarios and proper security level of loyalty transactions. At the same time they hardly reach compatibility with other loyalty systems which can be achieved through regional or industrial coalitions. 2018 shall bring new initiatives and solutions aimed for uniting diverse loyalty programs into a single, decentralized ecosystem which will guarantee proper confidentiality and respected interests of every participating Party. This shall give a fresh impetus to the loyalty market development by expanding it to a new global level. Moreover, decentralization will be able to spare loyalty programs from highly unpopular measures aimed at limiting the amount of deferred liabilities such as proprietary points and miles. An external decentralized intermediary system shall allow consumers to keep their bonuses, thanks to withdrawal option which can be used prior to expiration of proprietary points and miles. Thus the surplus of corporate liabilities caused by constant bonus issuance process will be additionally compensated by this option enabled with decentralized loyalty ecosystem.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Comprehensive simplification of retail purchasing process
      </strong>
      , increasing convenience for consumers, the introduction of pre-ordering and self-service systems for offline stores, the further development of distance order trading with flexible delivery service. In 2018, buyers will no longer be surprised at the lack of cashiers on exit and cash-desk queues have good chance to turn into exotics already this year. There is a great potential for further development of automated delivery systems for remote and sparsely populated areas using drones and other exotic means but conventional courier delivery business will continue to evolve together with an increase in online sales.

     <h2>
      MAIN HOLDING FACTORS FOR RETAIL
     </h2>
     <p>
      <strong>
       High cost of ownership
      </strong>
      is caused not just by technologies (they are being improved and become cheaper every year), but rather by centralization and closeness of legacy loyalty systems. Every program shall bear the costs for the creation and deployment together with operation, which will never allow making loyalty systems a truly mass product, affordable for smaller market players.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Expiration of points
      </strong>
      âââan extremely unpopular measure that hurts service expansion, but this is inevitable for every retailer at least until there is an alternative way of limiting deferred liabilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       E-cash
      </strong>
      and card transactions help to simplify the presentation of privileges to consumers and redemption process, but transition to cashback inevitably leads to the loss of the loyalty âgameâ with consumers, thus loosing the key success factor of any loyalty program. Banks and payment systems are in love with cashback, but is it so useful to retailers !?
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Mastering cashback
      </strong>
      as a replacement of bonus points leads to direct competition between retailers which, instead of paying-back for their investments in loyalty programs, throw their marginality into the furnace of price wars
     </p>

     </p>
     <p>
      CONSUMER LIMITATIONS restrain the evolution no less than the factors described above
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       The relentless pressure of program proposals
      </strong>
      has already led to loyalty market saturationâââto such an extent that it affected the ability of consumers to effectively use their subscribed programs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       The complexity of signing-in and adaptation
      </strong>
      is due not so much to the complexity of working with a single program, as to the problems faced by a consumer who has to repeatedly go through the same procedures
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Controlâ
      </strong>
      ââit is already impossible for average consumer to effectively accumulate and timely reward bonus points of numerous loyalty programs
     </p>
     <p class="press-center">
      <img src="/en/images/articles/10/img_6.jpeg"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      If the current trend will not change very soon, and the number of proprietary centralized loyalty and discount programs will continue to grow at the same pace, then the percentage of active users will drop down to 30% by 2020.
     </p>
     <p>
      This will cast a doubt on the feasibility of creating new legacy loyalty programs.

     <p>
      Comments to the basic set of properties necessary for making possible the decentralization of loyalty ecosystem:
     </p>
     <p>
      Any
      <strong>
       customer-specific data, business algorithms and methods
      </strong>
      , as well as operating conditions of existing loyalty programs
      <strong>
       should remain confidential
      </strong>
      in case of their joining the global decentralized loyalty ecosystem;
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Economic viability and unification
      </strong>
      are also the determining factors of success.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is essential that the
      <strong>
       consumer abstraction
      </strong>
      from numerous proprietary loyalty interfaces is not proclaimed mandatory, but it
      <strong>
       will be a rescue for those consumers who have already accumulated so much fatigue that they are potentially ready to ignore
      </strong>
      any other loyalty proposals.

      <strong>
       LIQUID BONUSÂ®â
      </strong>
      ââis an independent, universal and compatible instrument allowing to minimize or compensate the most of the friction and problems inherent in existing centralized loyalty systems.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Every Interface (Gateway)
      </strong>
      between the existing legacy loyalty programs and external decentralized Liquid BonusÂ® ecosystem will be fully controlled and operated by an appropriate participating program, which will be able to setup and change input/withdrawal transaction fee and other condition(s) if and when necessary.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Direct use of Liquid BonusÂ® tokens
      </strong>
      shall make it possible to increase the customers involvement in the loyalty ecosystem. This applies consumers who can more effectively manage the accumulation and redemption of privileges through the unified compatible user interface, as well as suppliers and smaller retailers unable to setup and operate legacy loyalty system.

      <strong>
       The global ecosystem of loyalty without the intermediary Liquid BonusÂ® infrastructure
      </strong>
      is looking like the global cellular communication ecosystem before the introduction of automatic roaming service. At that time, all mobile network operators worked autonomously, providing communication services solely to their regional subscribers. Some of them have later managed to sign direct agreements with other operators thus only covered subscribers were benefitting from a manual roaming service (roaming by prior application).
      <i>
       In fact, such transitional business model is very similar to the modern loyalty coalitions that do not eliminate the main friction of centralized systems thus remaining âlocalâ by either geographical or business feature.
      </i>

     <p>
      <strong>
       The global ecosystem of loyalty having the intermediary Liquid BonusÂ® infrastructure
      </strong>
      shall be very similar to the modern mobile ecosystem having an automatic roaming service as unified and transparent service. Indeed, when going to another country, we never think of which mobile operator provides communication service. But it often happens that subscribers connect &amp; call through competitive network, operated by a company which is in direct competition to the home network operator. Nevertheless, this seemingly ambiguous situation does not prevent subscribers from getting the telco service &amp; paying for it, and
      <strong>
       <i>
        at the end of the day, it turns to be not so ambiguous for mobile operators profiting from a seemingly contradictory business.
       </i>

      Blockchain was chosen as core technology for implementing a decentralized loyalty ecosystem, not as a tribute to fashion, but primarily as a
     </p>
     <p>
      - technology that enables trust to a lot of non-trusting Parties and doing it without a trusted Arbitrator who must have 100% confidence of all participants.
     </p>
     <p>
      - open technology, allowing to ensure confidentiality to every participating Party (otherwise regulators would never blame crypto-currencies for non-transparency of participants)
     </p>
     <p>
      - technology that has an excellent properties for multiple peers and communities

     <p>
      Organization of the global Liquid BonusÂ® ecosystem in terms of its operation and development should be implemented as an Association of Participants. All decisions will be made on the basis of consensus. By the way, this method of decision-making process has been built in our blockchain software as an algorithm.
     </p>
     <p>
      After its commercial launch, the global, decentralized, compatible blockchain Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty system will be operated and developed by its associate members.
     </p>

     </p>
     <p>
      I have got the following questions at the conference:
      <strong>
       âWhich role the developer of the system sees in its operation and further development? and Where is your commercial benefit from the creation of this Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty ecosystem?â
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Currently FINSTICK Innovations bears the whole burden of financing the development of the Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty ecosystem. We intend to return our investment through the initial LiqBo tokens offering (the further issuance of LiqBo tokens will be carried by Participants on the basis of consensus). In addition to it, FINSTICK Innovations intend to remain a part of the Liquid BonusÂ® Association by operating one of the Liquid BonusÂ® Core Nodes (thus entitled for getting a proportional part of operating fees). We also intend sell technical consulting and system integration services which are among FINSTICK Innovations core business activities.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Currently, the valuable stake of the pre-mined LiqBo tokens is already being offered to investors and companies that are interested in early participation, including the process of integration, pilot and launch of the decentralized Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty ecosystem

     <h2>
      Yet another look at the crypto-currency evolution scenario.
     </h2>
     <p>
      Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies have been shocking the public throughout 2017 with their firm and progressive pump. With the onset of 2018, the general growth surprise was replaced by their surprising fall. At the beginning, everyone was waiting for the end of Chinese New Year holidays, then the reduction of negative market news, then a miracleâ¦ but the miracle failed to happen and capitalization continued to decline. What are the reasons for this trend? Letâs try to figure it out.
     </p>
     <p>
      The heart of any crypto currency is the blockchain, which has a great application potential besides financial transactions though. There are many other use-cases for this new emerging technology. In reality, investorsâ funds are not just being blurred by numerous crypto-currency projects and forks, but also being flowed out into adjacent business segments to fund blockchain systems which are not related to crypto-currency at all.
     </p>
     <p>
      Moreover,  2018 has become a transitional period from the anarchically spontaneous use of new payment instruments (crypto currency in their existing form and ICO tokens) to a more meaningful and orderly utilization. It is also necessary to take into account the active interest of the banking community. For example,
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       - The activity of the R3 consortium (more than 100 financial institutions from six continents https://www.r3.com/about/) aiming at creation of an integrated interbank environment based on the distributed ledger platform for the exchange of documents and financial transactions;
      </li>
      <li>
       - The SWIFT Distributed Ledger Technology initiative, which has successfully completed blockchain proof of concept(PoC) together with 34 participating banks (https://www.swift.com/news-events/news/swift-completes-landmark-dlt-proof-of-concept),
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      and other projects, which will certainly lead to the emergence of competitive international corporate driven crypto-currency systems. In addition, the successful projects of individual banks, as well as the emergence of the national crypto-currencies, will complete the creation of a serious competitive environment and will definitely challenge the very existence of many âearly crypto-currenciesâ operated on a voluntary basis.
     </p>
     <p>
      The situation is further complicated by the fact that
      <strong>
       despite the already long circulation of Bitcoin and other popular crypto-currencies, they have not been able to find a decent market niche providing a constant consumer transaction flow, which is a necessary prerequisite for a stable level of capitalization
      </strong>
      . But instead, all the beneficial properties of crypto-currencies have been used exclusively for developing of a ânew generation speculative environmentâ. Today we observe the consequences of such an evolutionary stage. Once the speculators were exhausted and could no longer inflate the capitalization bubble of the crypto-currency market, the economy flew down, destroying along its path the fate of many latter-day traders and young âcrypto investment fundsâ that appeared on the wave of rapid market growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Crypto-currencies will have to find a ground in the form of a mass and everyday-used applications, which can attract and hold millions of new users other than those who already understand IT and hi-tech products
      </strong>
      . Only in this way will crypto-currencies find their space under the sun not just for a couple of years, but for many decades. And this process will no longer be directed by technology enthusiasts, but rather by experienced professionals, corporations, banks and the States.
     </p>
     <p>
      Considering the widespread recognition of the blockchain technology benefits for secure transactions, as well as the advantages that crypto-currencies promise to a global financial system, the emergence of national crypto-currencies and other instruments created by Central Banks and States, will soon turn to the pervasive reality. In parallel with this process, international settlement technologies using national crypto currencies will be defined and adopted. They will become the new standard and further evolution stage of crypto technologies and blockchain for cashless payments and banking services. At the same time,
      <strong>
       non-state public crypto-currencies will feel even greater pressure from national and international regulators who will strive to squeeze them out of the market.
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      All cryptographic tokens that are currently being issued by numerous ICOs will soon be finally grouped into three large groups:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       - Electronic shares and liabilities secured by real assets;
      </li>
      <li>
       - Mass market utilities (crypto-tokens, bonuses, points, valued objects for computer games, certificates of authenticity, etc.);
      </li>
      <li>
       - Garbage
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The instruments belonging to the first two categories will be governed by the relevant regulatory rules and laws, both national and international. The third category is the pure loss of todayâs investors. Nowadays it is very important to locate and understand the valuable properties of blockchain and crypto-currencies for every particular application in order to make a conscious decision about the appropriateness for business or attractiveness as an object for investment. There is a certain information vacuum in the market. Numerous training courses and seminars are devoted to investment and trading, but just a tiny fraction really correspond to blockchain technology and few are aimed at a broad audience. This situation is typical for times of market hype.  But it shall be changed in the near future. Thus development will take the evolutionary path and technology will become more accessible.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whatever happens with the market and, no matter what changes are applied by regulators and authorities, those who quickly understand and master new technologies and learn how to apply them in practice shall benefit first.

     <p>
      LiqBoÂ® Tokens are Ethereum based (ERC-20) utility tokens that are used to interact with, and sometimes even unlock some of the optional features inside the Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty Aggregation Media. Importantly, LiqBoÂ® Tokens are the only way to receive early access to the Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty Aggregation Media prior to its commercial launch. The Alpha and Beta stages of Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty Aggregation Media will require any participant in the system to have a minimal entry stake of LiqBoÂ® Tokens.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contributions to the LiqBoÂ® Token offering are paid to the Ethereum-based smart contract in either ETH or BTC at the receiving address created for the specific contributor. The number of booked LiqBoÂ® Tokens (the exchange rate to the mentioned crypto-currencies will be determined by the smart contract) are transferred to the contributorâs target wallet. For the duration of this process, which should be no more than a few minutes, the contributed funds will be held in escrow by the smart contract.

      Terms and Conditions
     </h1>
     <p>
      LiqBoÂ® Tokens are Ethereum based (ERC-20) utility tokens that are used to interact with, and sometimes even unlock some of the optional features inside the Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty Aggregation Media. Importantly, LiqBoÂ® Tokens are the only way to receive early access to the Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty Aggregation Media prior to its commercial launch. The Alpha and Beta stages of Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty Aggregation Media will require any participant in the system to have a minimal entry stake of LiqBoÂ® Tokens.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contributions to the LiqBoÂ® Token offering are paid to the Ethereum-based smart contract in either ETH or BTC at the receiving address created for the specific contributor. The number of booked LiqBoÂ® Tokens (the exchange rate to the mentioned crypto-currencies will be determined by the smart contract) are transferred to the contributorâs target wallet. For the duration of this process, which should be no more than a few minutes, the contributed funds will be held in escrow by the smart contract.
     </p>
     <p>
      The LiqBoÂ® Token offering does not constitute an offer or solicitation to sell shares or securities in FINSTICK Innovations LLC or any other related or associated company. Any such offer or solicitation would only be made by a confidential offering memorandum and in accordance with applicable laws. None of the information or analysis presented here are intended to form the basis for any investment decision, and no specific recommendations are intended. Accordingly, this document and(or) website does not constitute investment advice or counsel or solicitation for investment in any security.
     </p>
     <p>
      This document and(or) website does not constitute or form part of, and should not be construed as, any offer for sale or subscription of, or any invitation to offer to buy or subscribe for, any securities, nor should it or any part of it, form the basis of or be relied on in any connection with, any contract or commitment whatsoever. FINSTICK Innovations expressly disclaims any and all responsibility for any direct or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever arising directly or indirectly from:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       (i) reliance on any information contained in our whitepaper or on our website,
      </li>
      <li>
       (ii) any error, omission or inaccuracy in any such information or
      </li>
      <li>
       (iii) any action resulting therefrom.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The LiqBoÂ® Token, or âLiqBoÂ®â, is a cryptographic utility token. LiqBoÂ® Token is not a cryptocurrency.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the time of this writing,
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       (i) LiqBoÂ® cannot be exchanged for goods or services and
      </li>
      <li>
       (ii) LiqBoÂ® cannot be traded on any known exchanges at this time, however we plan to list LiqBoÂ® on token exchanges in the near future.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      There is no guarantee that the LiqBoÂ® you purchase will increase in value. It may decrease in value. LiqBoÂ® is not evidence of ownership or right to control. Controlling LiqBoÂ® does not grant its controller ownership or equity. LiqBoÂ® does not grant any right to participate in the control, direction or decision making of FINSTICK Innovations LLC or the Liquid BonusÂ® Loyalty Aggregation Media.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Token Offering Participation:
      </strong>
      It is the responsibility of the participants of the Pre-ICO and ICO token offering to ensure they are legally allowed to exchange ETH or BTC for LiqBoÂ® Tokens, in their country of domicile. FINSTICK Innovations accepts no responsibility for illegal participation, and we have no presence at location and(or) jurisdiction of every participant. FINSTICK Innovations LLC is a Russian legal entity which carry out this LiqBoÂ® Tokens distribution and acts on all other issues in accordance with laws and regulations of the Russian Federation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Refunds:
      </strong>
      Contribution refunds will only be given if Liquid BonusÂ® does not reach its minimum funding goal of 1 million LiqBoÂ® Tokens distributed via ICO. Any other refunds will be at the discretion of FINSTICK Innovations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Generation and distribution of LiqBoÂ® tokens:
      </strong>
      LiqBoÂ® Tokens will be generated after the completion of the final stage of the token offering. LiqBoÂ® Tokens will be distributed back to the same ETH address that the contributions arrived from.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Risk Factors:
      </strong>
      The FINSTICK Innovation LLC is newly incorporated (2017) and has no track record. However, the founding members have extensive qualifications and deep expertise that can be reviewed and evaluated. As with any startup, FINSTICK Innovation LLC carries a particular risk in terms of its ability to deliver its products and services described on this website and by the Whitepaper.
      <br/>
      The LiqBoÂ® Tokens have no liquidity upon issuance and only upon their inclusion among the offered cryptographic assets of the various exchanges targeted and described in this document will there be any practical means to achieve liquidity. The liquidity of LiqBoÂ® Tokens via these exchanges will be via other cryptographic tokens. In addition to it, LiqBoÂ® Tokens will be used by retailers as utilities enabling their loyalty program offerings. Despite all, there is a significant risk that the value of LiqBoÂ® Tokens on the exchanges, as well as any of the cryptographic assets they can be converted into, could decline, and then the initial investment made by a contributor could be lost.

      2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
     </h2>
     <p>
      Since their inception more than 100 years ago, loyalty programs have changed the way consumers
          interact with the companies from which they purchase products or services. According to some
          estimates, more than 75% of US adults participate in customer loyalty programs and more than $50
          billion in reward points and miles are issued by American businesses annually. Loyalty programs are
          considered to be one of the most effective ways for merchants to boost customer retention which are
          still far from exhausting of their capacities. Thus, for example, 57% of US brands are reported to have
          plans to increase loyalty program budgets in 2017.
     </p>
     <p>
      The global historical experience associated with the emergence and development of loyalty programs
          has shown that an integral element of implemented proprietary or partnership loyalty programs is the
          money surrogate, or a token whose equivalent value or benefit is determined solely by the loyalty
          programâs owner and issuer of such a token. The same owner-and-issuer makes any and all decisions on
          the ways and places of the issued tokens are being accepted and their maximum possible "weight"
          (percentage of the purchasing price), while neither global loyalty market turnover, nor the current
          global number of redeemed bonuses does not affect the value of a particular token in any way.
     </p>
     <p>
      The obvious forfeit for such exclusivity and flexibility in managing of the proprietary loyalty programs
          are:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       - The complexity and high cost of integrated system (including setup of issuance and redemption
            infrastructure, smooth execution of pre-defined reimbursement scenarios and establishing of
            secure environment for loyalty transactions)
      </li>
      <li>
       - The lack of interoperability with other loyalty systems, which are also built on proprietary
            technologies and bonus grant &amp; redemption scenarios.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Thus loyalty programs evolve to the supranational level exclusively together with multinational
          businesses, but it has not yet been able to overcome this basic obstacle to start freely entering the open
          global market.
     </p>
     <p>
      Program partnerships have grown way beyond the food and fuel model, becoming broad coalitions of
            marketers in many categories. In Canada and Europe, coalition loyalty programs introduced in the 90-s
            like Air Miles and Nectar, have been very successful mainly because of the greater consolidation than in
            the U.S. Today there are numerous new efforts to launch coalition loyalty programs and many more to
            appear thus this shall be considered as the steady trend. On the other hand, Millennial customers
            display even higher rates of sign up, earning, and redemption than other age groups â almost 70% of 20
            to 34 year olds said they would change where they shopped to get more loyalty rewards (according to
            Bond Loyalty Report).
     </p>
     <p>
      In this way, our goal is to build a global and open loyalty infrastructure answering to the
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       - request of corporations to consolidate the market by merging the maximum number of existing
            loyalty programs into a single supranational autonomous and self-sufficient system and
      </li>
      <li>
       - customersâ demand for an easy âclick-clickâ signup and smooth earning and redemption process
            which is limited neither by country nor by a loyalty program partnership
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      It is reasonably opportune and advantageous for all.
     </p>
     <p>
      The system and appropriate use-cases described in this whitepaper are aimed to change the existing
          loyalty ecosystem in order to ensure the global interoperability for all existing loyalty programs
          regardless of their owners and region of operation.
      <strong>
       FINSTICK Innovations team is pretty sure that
            finally the time has come for technology to become mature enough to establish the global reliable
            and secure borderless loyalty ecosystem making it possible to issue and redeem the valued digital
            bonus tokens in Â«one clickÂ» and inexpensive manner by any business no matter of its size or
            nationality.
      </strong>
      Moreover, unlike proprietary loyalty bonus points, miles and other legacy tokens, the new
          generation of crypto tokens (Liquid BonusÂ® Tokens) shall always have the value defined by the global
          market rather than by a single Loyalty Company or consortium of.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the initial stage of the project implementation, FINSTICK Innovations shall play the role of interexchange
          network administrator, providing access for new participants2, willing to take the operation
          burden in exchange to a stake of transaction fees. Later on, with the transition of the Liquid BonusÂ®
          Medium to its full commercial use, FINSTICK Innovations shall loose its role of the exclusive
          administrator, and the Liquid BonusÂ® Medium will go into the consensus based self-regulation mode by
          its participants - the owners of the nodes.
     </p>
     <p>
      So the global Liquid BonusÂ® network will be operated by the owners of Liquid BonusÂ® Nodes, offering
          users a high-speed, low-cost, very flexible and convenient sign up, earning, and redemption process
          using the blockchain based secure LiqBoÂ® Tokens anchored to the crypto-currency infrastructure3. Each
          Liquid BonusÂ® Core Node shall support the internal Liquid BonusÂ® blockchain infrastructure, and,
          communicating with other Liquid BonusÂ® Nodes, shall provide a nearly real-time operation and maintain
          the integrity of the whole Liquid BonusÂ® blockchain. Playing an essential role in the implementation of
          particular loyalty scenarios, secure smart loyalty contracts shall also be an integral part of the whole
          Liquid BonusÂ® Medium.
     </p>
     <h4 class="title-bold">
      CONCLUSION
     </h4>
     <p>
      This public offering of the LiqBoÂ® Tokens will raise funding for the ongoing development of the Liquid
            BonusÂ® Medium, integrate and setup of the Liquid BonusÂ® network having least 6 (six) independent
            Core Liquid BonusÂ® Nodes allowing to test, pilot and launch the pre- commercial Liquid BonusÂ® Medium
            which is capable to support realistic deployment conditions for rapid global growth accompanied by
            mass connections of participating loyalty programs willing to operate Loyalty Liquid BonusÂ® Nodes. A
            simultaneous transition to the targeted full-scale commercial operation mode with consensual selfregulatory
            functioning and development by its participants, the owners of Liquid BonusÂ® Nodes is to be
            done at this stage. Prospective contributors should carefully consider the matters set forth under the
