         I founded Stackr with Brendan in 2017 having worked for over 20 years in the financial services industry. The reason for founding Stackr is very personal – I wanted to make a material change, for the good, in the way people access savings. We have entered a new technological revolution and the traditional financial services companies are largely stuck in the past. With the knowledge I have gained over my time in traditional financial services and my willingness to embrace the future technology, I believe Stackr can bring about a fundamental change in the experience people have when it comes to saving.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have 22 years ‘experience in financial services, primarily focused on the international investment market leading to a proven track record in: new ventures, product development, legal structuring and the creation of global distribution networks. My passion is to turn good ideas into profitable businesses or business units.
        </p>
        <p>
         Prior to Stackr I was as the founder of Sanlam Global Investment Solutions (SGIS). Before joining SGIS, I was the Head of Product &amp; Investments at Glacier International. My previous roles have been largely concentrated on developing products and distribution for multi-national investment houses including, Old Mutual International, New Star Asset Management, TriAlpha Investment Advisors Limited &amp; the Stonehage Group.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have a B.Com (Law), an MBA, an Investment Management Certificate from the CFA Society of the UK and have most recently completed an executive program focused on Artificial Intelligence from MIT. I am also a member of STEP (Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners).

         I founded Stackr with Cobus in 2017 after 18 years in traditional financial services with a vision to change the way people save. I believe traditional financial services companies are not moving quickly enough to supply the latest investment opportunities and use the most up to the minute technology that can provide the optimal investment experience for clients. Stackr brings these elements together in a single solution for investors.
        </p>
        <p>
         My previous experience spans nearly 20 years and covers a huge geographical area from London to South Africa via Mauritius. My most recent role was as Head of Operations and Product Development at Sanlam Global Investment Solutions, a subsidiary of Sanlam (the largest financial services provider in Africa). Prior to this, I spent 2 years as an independent consultant; setting up international life, pension, advisory and distribution businesses, with a primary focus on the African, Middle East and European markets.
        </p>
        <p>
         Prior to this, I was a Partner at Armstrong Investment Managers LLP focusing on business development within Europe and Asia. Further roles include operational and business development functions at Insight Investment, Fidelity Investments, and Bank of New York Mellon.
        </p>
        <p>
         I hold a B.Com Corporate Finance and Economics degree from the University of Kwa-Zulu Natal, and the Investment Management Certificate from the CFA Society of the UK.
