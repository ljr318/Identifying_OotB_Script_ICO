        on the TikTok platform. According to a study, TikTok is having active users of about 800 million. With the platform’s vast growth potential, there are endless possibilities for brands to leverage the TikTok platform to grow their business.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       <span style="font-weight: 400;">
        Here, in this article, let’s discuss how brands can leverage TikTok to improve their business’s growth.
       </span>
      </p>
      <h2 style="text-align: justify;">
       1. Figure Out How The Platform Works
      </h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       <span style="font-weight: 400;">
        In the TikTok platform, there are two types of pages, such as the “For You Page” and the “Following Page.” Let’s get to know what these pages are.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       <b>
        “For You” Page
       </b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       <span style="font-weight: 400;">
        Whenever you sign up into the TikTok app, you will see a page with the list of many trending videos, the “For You” page. When you start following many content creators, you will get see much more content.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       <b>
        Following Page
       </b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       <span style="font-weight: 400;">
        The following tab will show the latest videos of the content creators that you are following. You can have an update on the latest activities and creations of the people who you are following on the TikTok platform. You can also check out the latest trends and hashtag challenges on the “Discover page” platform.
       </span>
      </p>
      <h2 style="text-align: justify;">
       2. Generate Entertaining And Creative Content
      </h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       <span style="font-weight: 400;">
        TikTok has become a popular platform only because of its unique and authentic video content. It is essential to create engaging content to enhance your brand awareness among the audience. Currently, people are becoming wary of the over-promotional content of the brands. Hence, you will need to create more engaging content that adds a higher value to your valuable customers. Always make sure to follow the same content tone. If your brand is well versed in creating entertaining content, you can stay consistent with it. But make sure that your content is authentic, original as well as appealing to the users.
       </span>
      </p>
      <h2 style="text-align: justify;">
       3. Advertise On TikTok
      </h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       <span style="font-weight: 400;">
        Currently, many businesses are making use of the TikTok platform for advertising their brands, products, and services. Here are some of the types of ads that will help you promote your business on the rapidly increasing platform.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       <span style="font-weight: 400;">
        In-Feed Native Content: The in-feed video lasts on the homepage for about 15 seconds only. You can create your brand story and leverage the in-feed native ad content and spread your brand awareness.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       <span style="font-weight: 400;">
        Top View: The Top view, though, lasts for only 15 seconds, yet it ensures to capture the attention of the TikTokers. It is a great way to promote your business among the audience.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       <span style="font-weight: 400;">
        Hashtag Challenges: Hashtag Challenges not only helps you in delivering your brand awareness but also increases the user-generated content. It is a great technique to advance your brand’s reach among the target audience.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       <span style="font-weight: 400;">
        Brand Takeovers: A brand takeover ad hooks the user’s attention with its visually appealing full-screen video. You can also link these types of ads to increase your site traffic.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       <span style="font-weight: 400;">
        Branded Lenses: TikTok takes a lot of initiatives to make the platform more engaging and attractive to the audience. Like the other platforms such as Instagram and Snapchat, in TikTok, also you avail of the 2D and 3D lenses for the brands to stay connected with their audience.
       </span>
      </p>
      <h2 style="text-align: justify;">
       4. Collaborate With Influencers

       Influencer Marketing Is Taking New Heights
      </h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       <span style="font-weight: 400;">
        Last but not the least, influencer marketing is on the rise. This is a tried and tested strategy that works very well on Instagram. And there are chances that this trend may change, but for now, this trend is growing strong year by year.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       <span style="font-weight: 400;">
        What will you be noticing this year is a lot less feed content and more Story content. As a brand or business, you need to be fully aware of how influencers you sponsor are planning to post their content related to your brand. Story and feed content come at different costs – the main reason for this is because Story content disappears after 24 hours, so it’s important to discuss these things when making a deal with influencers.

        When you choose to go and see a movie at the cinema, what do you do first, find out what is showing and what the ratings are don’t you. If nobody is talking about it, or only very few people have gone to see it, you’ll most likely rather skip that one and go to the show which attracts the biggest crowd. It’s normal human behavior. If after the show you want to grab a bite to eat, you are more likely to go into an establishment that is well frequented than go into the restaurant where you will be the only client. Once again, common human behavior and we are all programmed to behave in the same way.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       <span style="font-weight: 400;">
        Following someone on either YouTube, Twitter, FaceBook or where ever works in exactly the same way. You are far more likely to follow others who have already attracted a sizable following. The reason is very simple, because you are investing your time into who you are following, you need some encurence that your time will be rewarded by interesting and amusing content and the best way to assess whether or not the content will be worth your while is to see what others think of it.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       <span style="font-weight: 400;">
        Logic prevails that if a restaurant is any good, it will attract customers and if it doesn’t, then you are unlikely to spend your money there. But what if the restaurant is new, just opened and the food is really great, it is just that no one knows about it yet.

What the owner of the new restaurant needs to do inorder to get the business off the ground, is invite all his friends and family to occupy 30-50% of the seats in his restaurant, that way the restaurant will appear to be popular and actual customers will start noticing. Serve these customers with your great food and give them excellent service and voila, business is booming in no time.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       <span style="font-weight: 400;">
        So, you are new, or not so new on TikTok, but even though you have really got good content and have made some amazing videos which showcases both your amazing talent and your skill as an video editor, you just don’t seem to get the kind of ratings and exposure that you know you deserve. How do you attract people to your profile?
       </span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       <span style="font-weight: 400;">
        The algorithm employed by all social media platforms, including TikTok, picks up on the amount of followers a profile has and it actually promotes those profiles that has the most followers. Because it assumes, quite rightly, that profiles with many followers are popular and that even more people would like to see them the
       </span>
       <span style="font-weight: 400;">
        algorithm will alway favour profiles with many followers. Just like the restaurant cenario, the algorithm will ignore the profile with only a few followers, no matter what the content is, because the algorithm can’t
       </span>
       <span style="font-weight: 400;">
        judge content, it only works on what it can see.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       <span style="font-weight: 400;">
        For you this is actually good news. You can very easily and for very little expense get your ratings up, and let the algorithm take it from there. All that you need to do is go to Flymesocial and
        <a href="https://paymetoo.com/">
         buy TikTok likes
        </a>
        , this will then get picked up by TikTok’s very clever algorithm and it will start promoting your profile amongst your peers from around the world, where your actual future fans will get into contact with your amazing content and start to follow you.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       <span style="font-weight: 400;">
        It’s just as in the restaurant cenario, once you’ve got your fans on board, you have to simply serve them your delicious food, or in your case, your dancing, lip syncing, comedy acts. Once your fans have a taste of what you have to offer, they will keep on coming back and they will be bringing their friends along with them when they do. Can you see where this is going, before you know it, you will be rubbing shoulders with the stars and that just because you listened and followed the good advice that I am giving you.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       <span style="font-weight: 400;">
        So, come on, don’t just sit there dreaming, go to
