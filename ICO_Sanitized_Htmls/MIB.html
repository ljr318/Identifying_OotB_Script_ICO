        APPENDIX
        <br/>
        RISKS
        <br/>
        Disclaimer
        <br/>
        1. Participation in and exchange of MIB can entail risks.
        <br/>
        2. Before exchanging MIB, the Purchaser should consider earnestly all possible risk factors involved in it. Due attention should be paid to the information specified in this Policy, the Whitepaper, and other related documents, and we encourage you to consult with experts such as lawyers and accountants.
						3. Risks may arise in relation to the interpretation of the law by each regulatory body and authorities and that of the laws governing cryptocurrencies and taxation status as well as the changes to laws and taxes.
        <br/>
        4. Cryptocurrency can be restricted or controlled by various regulatory bodies within the respective jurisdictions. Your participation can be affected by the regulations or measures applicable in various jurisdictions that can hamper or restrict our ICO implementation, and these factors can increase the potential risks associated with your participation in ICO and exchange/use of MIB.
        <br/>
        5. We cannot guarantee post-ICO cryptocurrency transactions. The post-ICO trading in the secondary market can vary according to the approval or disapproval of MIB by each cryptocurrency exchange.
						6. Trade stability and functionality of cryptocurrencies may not be sufficiently provided by some exchanges. This trend can be aggravated through the exchange’s morale, business, or technical failure or through a new regulation restricting its functionality. Moreover, transactions in MIB may experience stagnation.
        <br/>
        7. MIB price can undergo extreme variations specific to cryptocurrencies, of which the extent can vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
        <br/>
        8. The Website, the Whitepaper, this Policy, and other ICO-related documents may include outlook reports presenting expected technical or economic results. Such projected outcomes may differ from reality.
						9. MIB, Wallet or other related websites can be exposed to hacker attacks, which can seriously affect the Company’s and Purchaser’s cryptocurrencies, MIB Platform, or ICO.
        <br/>
        10. MIB of one Purchaser or the entire Purchaser group may be put at risk by an attacker’s malignant use of a specific weak point or bug that may exist in the MIB core infrastructural element.
        <br/>
        11. The MIB being transferred between the Company and the Purchaser may be exposed to an external threat of theft.
        <br/>
        12. There may be additional uncertainties besides the technical risks and ICO-related uncertainties described above.
        <br/>
        13. We have disclosed all information about the risks associated with the exchange of MIB and participation in ICO within the reasonably estimable scope at the moment of the conclusion of the Agreement.

       </h3>
       <p>
        After the growth of blockchain-based Bitcoin, various cryptocurrencies have been issued out to become part of our real lives. But the cryptocurrencies and the Blockchain system Network are having problem with maintaining the system due to their excessive power consumption and costly equipments, thus they are not fulfilling the role as digital currency for everyone.
       </p>
       <p>
        WHY SO? That is because of the costly maintenance fee of the Blockchain system,
        <i>
         which leads to the monopolization by a certain coutnry and some people with large capital.
