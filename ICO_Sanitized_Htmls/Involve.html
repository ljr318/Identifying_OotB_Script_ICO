          For most of the population, cryptocurrencies are still a book with seven seals. As in traditional banking, an essential success factor is the formation of a mutual culture of trust. This has to be established between all market players such as governments, companies and consumers particularly those using this with their gaming such as judi online. After all, crimes such as money laundering or terrorist financing should not be masked by cryptocurrencies. The general chances and risks of cryptocurrencies are presented below.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Opportunities
         </h3>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Lower transaction costs than in conventional payment transactions
          </li>
          <li>
           Faster transfer speed
          </li>
          <li>
           Efficiency gains for payment systems
          </li>
          <li>
           Promising future blockchain technology
          </li>
          <li>
           Increasing popularity as an alternative investment due to loss of confidence in the existing banking and currency system as a result of the financial and sovereign debt crises
          </li>
          <li>
           High speculation gains possible
          </li>
          <li>
           Independence from government control
          </li>
          <li>
           Anonymity
          </li>
         </ul>
         <h3>
          Risks
         </h3>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Cyber ​​attacks through security holes
          </li>
          <li>
           Legal and compliance risks due to legal uncertainty due to a lack of proper legal definitions or classification by supervisory authorities (legal conflicts regarding money laundering and suspected fraud)
          </li>
          <li>
           Loss of confidence of the general population
          </li>
          <li>
           High volatility in price development
          </li>
          <li>
           Threat to stability in the financial system
          </li>
          <li>
           Use by criminals for illegal business
          </li>
          <li>
           Capacity problems of the blockchain

          Cryptocurrencies – curse or blessing for our monetary system?

         </p>
         <p>
          Without comprehensive state regulation of cryptocurrencies, there is a serious risk to the stability of our financial system due to the lack of a superior supervisory authority. Loss of trust in the banking system, currency fears and the global low interest rate phase intensify the flight into the alternative asset class cryptocurrencies. Despite the numerous risks, there are also some opportunities. First and foremost, the integration of inexpensive and fast transaction options into our existing financial system should be mentioned.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          The positive aspects have to be used sensibly for the further development of our monetary system. The prerequisite for this is the creation of reliable IT security . Furthermore, appropriate legal foundations are required so that the future economic, financial and monetary policy effects in the age of cryptocurrencies are not left to chance.

           One of the most widespread leisure pursuits enjoyed by a lot of individuals across the globe is
           <span style="color: #ffffff;">
            online gambling.
           </span>
          </strong>
          With hundreds of gambling/betting sites operating online, players are presented with plenty of opportunities to play for actual money and conveniently from their mobile device.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           When selecting an online gambling website to wager, play and potentially win in actual money from real money games, you need to know the various payment options the site accepts or supports.
          </strong>
          Although most people make use of credit cards, prepaid cards, bank transfers, debit cards, and ewallets, many have already began making use of cryptocurrencies as many online gambling sites have also started to accept and support these virtual currencies.

         <p>
          When opting to use cryptocurrency to place wagers, there are a few things you have to consider. Although cryptocurrency guarantees your safety and protection, you still have to make certain that the online gambling site you register and play on is legal, trusted and credible.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Major Types of Crypto Online Gambling Site
         </h3>
         <p>
          There are two major types of crypto online gambling sites – cryptocurrency-only betting websites and established online gambling websites with crypto as an alternative.
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Cryptocurrency-only Betting Websites.
           </strong>
           These are online gambling sites that only accept certain types of cryptos. This means that players cannot make use of real money or fiat currencies. These types of online gambling sites are fairly new in the online gambling landscape; hence they are missing a proven history or excellent reputation of being reliable and dependable. However, as such sites only accept cryptocurrencies, payouts tend to be processed much quicker. Moreover, the variety of cryptocurrencies you could use is broad.
          </li>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Established Online Gambling Websites with Crypto as Wagering or Payment Option.
           </strong>
           Online gambling sites or sportsbooks that have been around in the online gambling landscape for quite some time now may have added cryptocurrency as a wagering and payment option. These types of sites are the best choice as you could check on their history or reputation in terms of trust, dependability and credibility. But the downside is that they might only accept certain or limited types of cryptos. Therefore, before signing up, check on which types of cryptos the online gambling site accepts.
          </li>
         </ul>

          Other Factors to Consider
         </h3>
         <p>
          When choosing an online gambling site to play at and make use of crypto, there are a few things to consider.
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Always check on the trust score, reputation and credibility (and the experience) of the website to ensure you will be in a safe and secure gambling environment. Make certain they have the proper licensed and are regulated, a site that will definitely protect all your information with their Privacy Policy which you should read as well.
          </li>
          <li>
           Make time to learn and study about the software used by the website as this has an important function to play in terms of selecting games and payment/payout options. So, make certain the software is reliable to avoid any trouble in the future.
          </li>
          <li>
           Although cryptocurrency allows you to play in online gambling sites anonymously, you still have to make sure that the site has a reliable encryption software to ensure every transaction you make is secure and that your data are also stored in a very secure sever. Also ensure that customer support/service is reliable and reachable 24/7 in through varied means.

          Although many countries are beginning to recognize the potentials of online gambling, specifically as a source of income of the government, it continues to be heavily regulated.
         </p>
         <p>
          The blockchain is decentralized which means that nobody, no financial institution, not even the government, could regulate or govern it nor could they impose certain laws. This is why many countries have reservations and uncertainties about it, especially it

          Gambling with Cryptocurrency
         </h2>

           <a href="http://icoinvolve.io/2020/05/27/playing-on-crypto-friendly-online-casinos/" title="Playing On Crypto-friendly Online Casinos">
            using cryptocurrency in gambling
           </a>
           being legal or illegal, it will depend on whether online gambling in that specific country or area is legal or not.
          </strong>
          Online gambling itself is a conflict-ridden topic where many have strong sentiments against legalizing it. For instance, being empowered by an innovative payment method provides substantial flexibility to individuals who would want to place wagers using real money. Several even dispute that legalizing online gambling will make underage gambling very difficult and may be impossible to stop and prevent. Although this is a reasonable point, the probabilities are if a nation do legalize online gambling, putting in wagers or bets with cryptocurrency or digital currencies will most likely be allowed as well.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Cryptocurrency and Online Gambling License
         </h3>
         <p>
          A gambling license functions as proof or evidence that the business is legitimate which allows the owner to set up an account from the bank allowing it to process wire transfers as well as credit card payments.
          <strong>
           With the blockchain technology, banks that act as middlemen become unnecessary since the network is a system that is self-governed.
          </strong>
          This would then mean that online gambling facilities could function even without a gambling license insofar as they are adapted or tailored to work with payments or transactions done through the blockchain.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           This doesn’t sound so bad since such transactions over the blockchain network are almost instant as well as safe as they are secured by really strong encryption.
          </strong>
          Thus, it develops into a matter of individual choice or preference if you would choose to transact with a gambling operator that don’t have a license or a license and reputable gambling operator, where there are several of both types of operators that accept cryptocurrencies.

          Worry no more because we got you covered! As a matter of fact, the entire process of using Bitcoin to play in an online gambling site is
          <em>
           <u>
            broken down into three simple steps
           </u>
          </em>
          which are discussed in the following:
         </p>
         <h4>
          <strong>
           Step 1. Create and Open Your Bitcoin Wallet

          </strong>
          . You’ll be using your credit or debit card or bank account to load money to your wallet. Then, you can use the wallet in making deposits or purchases to online gaming site the same thing you’d do with PayPal.
         </p>
         <p>
          The difference between the two is that with a Bitcoin wallet,
          <em>
           you can convert your money into Bitcoins to push through with the transactions
          </em>

         </h4>
         <p>
          As soon as you have successfully set up your account, the next thing that you should do is deposit money and buy some Bitcoins. Keep in mind that much like with other currencies,
          <u>
           the rate of Bitcoin fluctuates
          </u>
          so be sure to check the rate first before finalizing your purchase.

            You could choose to deposit into your Bitcoin account either via credit card or debit card. Or, you can just link your bank account directly to your Bitcoin wallet.

          <strong>
           Similar to judi online, the rise of cryptocurrencies (digital currencies) in this era of digitization that is constantly advancing has been very quick.
          </strong>
          Cryptocurrencies have now entered into conventional businesses because of the internet that has enabled and aided cryptocurrencies to turn into one of the most convenient options for payment for many online betting and gambling sites.
         </p>
         <h2>
          How Great Is Cryptocurrency in Judi Online
         </h2>
         <p>
          Cryptocurrencies are progressively and steadily spreading through the industry of betting and judi online as
          <strong>

           </a>
           .
          </strong>
          How? Let’s check out a few:
         </p>
         <h3>
          More Options for Payment
         </h3>
         <p>
          Cryptocurrencies present the bettor or gambler with more alternatives for payment.
          <strong>
           When gambling sites online acknowledge cryptocurrencies, bettors are given an option to not rely on traditional banking services for their payments to be processed.
          </strong>
          Typically, payments that involve bank transactions may require a certain amount time to complete the process which also includes some fees you have to pay. In some cases, transactions may be unexpectedly be cancelled or stopped if and when fraud is suspected making it a nuisance. Today, everyone, including bettors, want a swift, effortless and more secure payment alternative and cryptocurrencies provide such.

          Better Security
         </h3>
         <p>
          The blockchain technology is utilized by cryptocurrencies making them completely secure due to its innate features in terms of immutability, meaning it cannot be modified, changed or altered after it is generated.
          <strong>
           As crypto is in an environment that is transparent, manipulating or altering it is impossible.
          </strong>
          Cryptos are digital assets that are encrypted which can’t be hacked or copied since crypto transactions are validated by every participant preventing any form of wrongful doings. Moreover, the security protocol of the blockchain technology stops the interference of transactions making it impossible to snip and steal from crypto wallets.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Zero to Less Transaction Fees
         </h3>
         <p>
          <strong>
           The absence of middle-men or intermediaries such as banks as well as other financial institutions aid in considerably reducing fees when transacting with crypto.
          </strong>
          Actually, several casinos that accept cryptocurrencies to do business without any fee wherein the players or users are only required to pay a very minimal network fee.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Trust
         </h3>
         <p>
          <strong>
           With better security comes improved trust.
          </strong>
          Because of this factor, the online gambling industry are able to retain its users or players as they are confident that they won’t lose any money that I stored in their crypto wallet.

           exchanges
          </em>

         </p>
         <blockquote>
          <p>
           <em>
            On betting exchanges, the users or punters are capable of backing both odds that are offered by other users or offer the odds for other users to back. This is otherwise called as “laying odds” and empower te bettor of exchange to act as a bookmaker. It may seem confusing at first but as you get along in sports betting, you’ll get the hang of it.
           </em>

          <strong>
           Not many experts recommend placing investment funds such as 401 (k) pension plans with bitcoin. Digital currencies are too easy to change.
          </strong>
          But there is nothing wrong with setting a small amount of money that you allow to be lost or for illegal betting, such as gambling by carrying a few dollars at the casino.
         </p>
         <p>
          Bitcoin certainly offers an adrenaline rush. In 2017 the
          <a href="/">
           biggest cryptocurrency price
          </a>
          jumped from less than US $ 1,000 to almost US $ 20,000, then fell to the lowest level of US $ 6,647.33 over the weekend after the South Korean exchange was hacked. On Monday (11/6) yesterday, bitcoin was traded at the level of US $ 6,768.00.
         </p>
         <p>
          Investment signals remain mixed: Google’s search activity on bitcoin has dropped 75 percent as prices have jumped from the level of US $ 20,000, but large Wall Street companies are making investments that show they expect a cryptocurrency to remain part of the financial landscape.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           There are two ways to bet on bitcoin, the “old-fashioned” way, through special exchange exchanges and buying or selling futures contracts.
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7eUJd9tjb24?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" height="377" title="What is the difference between cryptocurrency spot trading and futures trading?" width="670">

         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Here are a few things to consider:
          </strong>
         </p>
         <h3>
          <strong>
           Trade on the Bitcoin Spot Market
          </strong>
         </h3>
         <p>
          <strong>
           New coins are given to “miners” to solve complex mathematical problems.
          </strong>
          Then the coins are bought and sold in dollars or other currencies in an account called a wallet, stored in a currency exchange such as Coinbase, Bitstamp or Kraken.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Trading in the spot market is very similar to stock trading
          </strong>
          , with prices governed by supply and demand, and there is no role played by central banks, such as the Federal Reserve. Because bitcoin has not been accepted by many traders, its value depends on the speculators’ views on what other people will pay in the future. For critics, bitcoin is seen as a bubble. While advocates see a large potential for profit.
         </p>
         <p>
          Most of the more than 100 bitcoin exchanges are only a few years old, and some have fallen victim to fraud, theft, hacking and growing illness, such as trading stops.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Investors are very careful to buy bitcoin on the exchange and then store the bitcoin code from the site or even on a piece of paper
          </strong>
          – that is what bitcoin initial users, Winklevoss, will do so far to cut their code into pieces and store it in a vault use a system that only they understand to return the actual bitcoin code.
         </p>
         <p>
          Bitcoin itself is full of risks, even if the trading and storage system is safe.
         </p>
         <p>
          Unfortunately, bitcoin exchange doesn’t work as efficiently as a stock exchange, said Param Vir Singh, professor of business technology for the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University.
         </p>
         <blockquote>
          <p>
           “The price of Bitcoin is changing; slow transaction speed; bitcoin trading platforms are illiquid, “he said, noting that, unlike the stock exchange, bitcoin exchanges are generally not well regulated by the government.
          </p>

          Cryptocurrencies, one of the drivers of growth to online gambling in Asia, is now supported by numerous blockchain fintechs in the Philippine’s economic zone.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Philippine government, which licenses and regulates offshore gaming operators that provide igaming technology and products in Asia, has provided the outsourcing companies with cryptocurrency support for its international wagering transactions. In fact, the free-trade Cagayan Economic Zone Authority (CEZA) established the “Crypto Valley of Asia” as part of its bid to become the first Asian economic zone to license, regulate and cultivate offshore virtual currency fintech companies.
         </p>
         <p>
          In February 2019, Raul Lambino, CEZA Chief Executive had announced the approval of the first 10 blockchain platform providers for offshore cryptocurrency exchanges. To date, there are about 48 cryptocurrency fintechs licensed by CEZA, currently operating blockchain platforms in the “Crypto Valley of Asia,” According to CEZA Chief Raul Lambino, the blockchain platforms can engage in crypto-mining, raise funds by way of Initial Crypto Offerings (ICO) as well as participate in cryptocurrency exchanges.
         </p>
         <p>
          However, Lambino stressed that exchanges of virtual currency into real money and vice versa, are allowed only for offshore cryptocurrency transactions. The CEZA Chief underscored the importance of observing this particular CEZA rule, in order to avoid infringing on Philippine regulations.

          Bitcoin and several other digital currencies or more popularly known as cryptocurrency (crypto) are harnessing so much controversy in financial world. Its value is
          <em>
           based on blockchain technology
          </em>
          or set of complex and sophisticated codes that could be shared among several computers. But here’s the catch,
          <strong>
           every block remains completely anonymous and free from government issuer
          </strong>
          . This as a result made crypto a lot more appealing both for legit and illegal applications like supply chain transactions between vendors and company and money laundering respectively. Even in some online casinos, they are accepting Bitcoins as an exchange of transaction. If you are playing in
          <em>
           <u>
            Bola Tangkas

          , try to check if such option is available.
         </p>
         <h3>
          <strong>
           It’s the Risk and Reward of Crypto
          </strong>
         </h3>
         <p>
          Now, trying to veer from its expected purpose, digital currencies have been used as a vehicle for having serious speculation among investors and traders. Currently,
          <em>
           <u>
            Bitcoin’s value shoots to over 20,000 dollars in 2017
           </u>
          </em>
          before it falls back drastically. Massive swings in price daily are causing fortunes to be lost and won among traders and investors. After all, this is a normal scenario when trading in such. While there are many financial professionals who see big potential in it, others do feel that it is representing highly inflated assets.

           What does Experts have to Say?

         </h3>
         <p>
          So anonymously, what do these financial experts really say about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the market these days?
         </p>
         <blockquote>
          <p>
           <em>
            At the moment, bitcoin is decentralized and virtual currency that is used for trading services and goods. Being decentralized, it isn’t backed by any company, organization or body of government. Truly, Bitcoin is a global unregulated currency that isn’t taxed at any form. There have been multiple attempts made in harnessing virtual currency but similar to government attempts in regulating the internet, all attempts have failed.
           </em>
          </p>
         </blockquote>

          Sooner or later,

           <a href="/2020/04/14/the-best-things-about-playing-online-gambling/">
            Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies

           would likely be regulated in order to have lasting power

          . The only question remains is, how and who. Right now, Senate Homeland Security as well as the Government Affairs Committee is doing investigation about Bitcoins and several other digital currencies in the market.
         </p>
         <p>
          FinCEN had already issued guidance in relation to virtual currencies as well as its exchanges and administrators that are subjecting these companies to same regulatory responsibilities as with other financial institutions. Believe it or not, NY Department of Financial Services have sent several subpoenas to businesses that are in association with Bitcoin to provide info about their policies and to avoid money laundering and to ensure consumer protections.
         </p>
         <p>
          Another financial expert mentioned that
          <strong>
           Bitcoin is an interesting concept
          </strong>
          but there’s a flaw in regulating currency supply. Since bitcoin supply does not increase in growth proportion or use of it, it creates a deflationary effect. Thus, it
          <em>
           <u>
            generates incentives for those who are hoarding bitcoins than spending them
           </u>

          ; various stock markets took a deep dive, huge drop in oil prices and suffering of international economies. Same story goes with cryptocurrencies. Back in first week of February, 1 Bitcoin is worth over 10,000 dollars. Then just a week later, its stock crashed to whopping 4,000 dollars. The impact of the pandemic is obviously felt, no doubt about that. Basically, other cryptocurrencies have seen the same fate like:

         </ul>
         <p>
          The rapid drop in crypto’s value, made many of its
          <u>
           investors suddenly feel skeptic
          </u>
          whether it’s a safe investment or not during tough economic times. Fact is, some of them were thinking whether or not stick back to fiat currency as a smarter alternative.
         </p>
         <blockquote>
          <p>
           <em>
            While cryptocurrency has taken the market by storm and brought so much hype for the past few years, you’ll be surprised that it has not successfully gone yet to mainstream. And in the reality of the situation, it showed that there’s no “asset” that is safe from anything.

          As per experts, one of the notable benefits provided by digital currency is that, it is
          <strong>
           impossible for it to be counterfeited and all transactions

         <blockquote>
          <p>
           <em>
            Credit cards on the other hand are operating on pull basis in which the store is identifying the transaction and then, pulls the amount of sale from the card. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency follows a “push” model transaction where it is prompting the holder to exactly send what they wanted to the seller without requesting additional information.
           </em>
          </p>
         </blockquote>

          On Withdrawing or Cashing Out
         </h3>
         <p>
          When winning big at a casino game, players are certainly eager to make that huge withdrawal. However, it would take around three to five business days for your winnings to appear in your bank account. With fiat currency, trust between the casino and bank and the other way around is needed. But, in terms of releasing your winnings, banks will have to make you wait until the money is cleared instead of trusting the casino.

         <blockquote>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           For a crypto-friendly casino, as soon as your payment is processed, it is directly sent to the network of digital assets. Depending on the option of crypto you use, your crypto winnings would arrive in your wallet in a very short period of time, from a couple of minutes to an hour.
          </p>

          With the quick process of withdrawing funds using cryptocurrency, collecting your winnings are much quicker. Moreover, players aren’t compelled to have a huge bankroll when playing at online casinos. Additionally, having the ability to withdraw after every gaming session allows players to transfer between casinos instead of adding more funds or moving your bankroll to another venue.
