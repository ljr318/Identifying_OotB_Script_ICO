         today. It is a safe to use app that runs very smoothly and transfers files easily.
        </p>
        <p>
         Unlike the traditional ways of wirelessly transferring/sharing files, SHAREit app has revamped the genre completely. Instead of making use of the ever-popular Bluetooth, it makes use of a far better technology, the Wi-Fi. SHAREit uses Wi-Fi Direct to the very core when it comes to file sharing and transferring. Bluetooth is no-doubt a great technology that has pioneered all the way up to Bluetooth 5.0. It makes use of a good file transfer speed of up to 40 Mbps, but it falls short when compared to SHAREit.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is undoubtedly the best file sharing and transfer app out there. With so many features and much more to offer, the SHAREit app has become the most-widely used file sharing app out there. It has crossed the 200 million plus download mark and the stats keep on increasing. SHAREit  is an easy process and the app is way faster than Bluetooth or
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication">
          NFC
         </a>
         . Surprisingly, the Wi-Fi Direct on this app is faster than most of the USB wired connections. The interface is simple and very easy to understand. Its file size is quite small and that makes it compatible with most of the smartphones and tablets.

        <ul>
         <li>

In case of, authentication and transfer is done through Wi-Fi Direct. This means that at first, there is a WPS enabled network that gets created and then only does the file transfer take place.
