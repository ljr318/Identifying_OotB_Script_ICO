          Децентрализация - процесс распределения функций, сил, власти, людей от управляющего органа. Это
                            процесс,
                            где все участники обладают равными правами. Отсюда и пошло понятие одноранговая сеть, которая
                            часто
                            применяется в IT-индустрии. Участники сети обладают одним рангом.
         </div>
         <div class="mt-2">
          В менеджменте децентрализация означает делегирование полномочий, где подчиненных наделяют
                            большей
                            властью, но при этом они сами несут ответственность.
         </div>
         <div class="mt-2">
          Если речь идёт о банках, биржах, юридических сферах, бухгалтерских и так далее. Всегда есть
                            посредник,
                            который несёт ответственность за безопасность ваших средств, документов и тд.
         </div>
         <div class="mt-2">
          Приведем пример, опираясь на продукты, созданные компанией Streamity.
         </div>
         <div class="mt-2">
          Компания не хранит, внутри своих сервисов, средства на своих кошельках, не имеет доступа к
                            традиционным
                            счётам людей, к приватным ключам, проще говоря к любым финансовым активам пользователей. Каждый
                            человек
                            сам несёт ответственность за безопасность своих средств. Если Вы получите пароль от аккаунта
                            одного
                            из
                            продуктов компании, например StreamDesk или STM Wallet, Вы ничего не сделаете с этими данными,
                            там
                            нет
                            денег и никакой важной информации, взлом аккаунта теряет всякий смысл.
         </div>
         <div class="mt-2">
          Не только информация но и финансы и все процессы, переходят на прямую от одного пользователя
                            другому и
                            никто не может повлиять на этот процесс.
