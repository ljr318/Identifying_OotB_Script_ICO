            10 years of research across Asia and Africa, carried out by the authors of Portfolios of the Poor, showed that poverty proliferates in regions whose inhabitants do not have access to financial services. Humaniq is becoming the simplest route to financial inclusion for billions of people.

            According to Metcalfe's law, the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its users. For Humaniq, this means that the more unbanked people who join the system, the greater the motivation will be for other people to join.

A blockchain frees people from the need for any big, central authority in order to simply transact and speak with each other. It is a shared, decentralised database run by a peer-to-peer network of computers or nodes, as opposed to the central server that runs traditional applications and websites. Every request to make a transaction, such as when one person agrees to lend money to another who wishes to borrow, is information that is distributed across this network, not stored in one place. The result is a permanent, incorruptible and secure record of each and every transaction, stored across the network publically and chronologically on what is referred to as a &lsquo;digital ledger&rsquo; in &lsquo;blocks&rsquo; of data.</p>"},"how-transactions-are-verified":{"title":"How transactions are verified","id":"how-transactions-are-verified","level0":"technical-mecca","level1":"Crypto Basics","article":"<p>A blockchain, as a decentralised network, liberates people from a reliance on the old, centralised banks, opening up banking services to those currently able to access them. To make this possible, however, there is a challenge that needs to be overcome. The shared, distributed record of the fact that all the transactions have been made requires some of the computing power of those providing the computers, or nodes, to run the system. In order to achieve this, each person who offers their hardware and storage space for the purpose of sustaining the blockchain is rewarded with cryptocurrency. The amount that they are paid is calculated by an internal, virtual machine called gas, which efficiently and fairly identifies the relative cost of different computing operations, in order to incentivise contributions.</p>"},"hmq-and-ethereum":{"title":"HMQ and Ethereum","id":"hmq-and-ethereum","level0":"technical-mecca","level1":"Crypto Basics","article":"<p>HMQ is the Humaniq cryptocurrency token.

This ERC20 standard allowed HMQ to immediately work with all decentralised apps that also conform to the standard, which means that if you use any of a number of mobile wallet such as, for example, Coinbase and Jaxx you can hold HMQ. It also means that HMQ are easily exchangeable with other cryptocurrency tokens that follow the ERC20 rules, including Ether, the Ethereum token. Humaniq is still young: our ICO (initial coin offer) was only held in April 2017 and the Humaniq app launch is scheduled for August.

Other providers have since launched other blockchains in order to cater for such wider applications, including Ethereum, which in 2016 launched a new, open-source, blockchain as a platform for any applications that cut out middle-men and widen access to services..

It also opens up the possibility of a new, peer-to-peer, sharing economy, where people can directly send and receive, lend and borrow money to and from each other, rather than relying on financial industry and its fee-charging field representatives.

Successes help us to show users, partners and investors potential uses and impacts of the Humaniq app and the HMQ tokens, knowledge that helps us to achieve our aims.

We want to encourage feedback and suggestions in our community as Humaniq grows. We can all help to do this by being respectful of others and what they have to say. A peer-to-peer economy both tears down old ways of doing things and makes individual respect more important. And a community where everybody feels comfortable to express themselves and to contribute is a community that will learn, strengthen and flourish.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Collaborate</strong>. The beauty of the Humaniq app is that it underpins peer-to-peer collaboration.

Aren&rsquo;t you just another mobile wallet?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Humaniq is a cryptocurrency unlike any other. We are working to put currency into the hands of the 2bn unbanked people. The barriers to use are low, with voice and face recognition technologies used so that the uneducated and the undocumented can access the app and open an account.</p>\r\n<p><strong>It sounds accessible. But is this enough to succeed in putting cryptocurrency into the hands of the many?</strong></p>\r\n<p>With Humaniq, everybody can mint coins. Unlike with other cryptocurrencies, it is not about being the first to own the coins, or having access to specialised hardware or spending a lot on electricity. Everybody, once they have used their face to pass authentication, is rewarded with HMQ. Then, when they interact with the app, they earn more. The minting of coins will continue until we have 2 billion users.</p>\r\n<p><strong>But wasn&rsquo;t other cryptocurrency also aimed at developing countries?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Other crypto also uses Ethereum&rsquo;s custom-built Blockchain to provide new, safe and secure, currency. But it is not used in unbanked regions because it is limited in supply, because of relative usage complexity, and because it is not promoted. The transaction capacity limit of Bitcoin is 250 thousand, compared to PayPal&rsquo;s 100 million active accounts. We have researched the markets we are targeting, and recruited dozens of prominent bitcoiners living in developing countries to our Humaniq Ambassador Program. They are teaching people how to use Humaniq - and earn cryptocurrency for that.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why use the Blockchain to make payments?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Blockchain is a decentralised way of confirming transactions that steps into the breach that has been created by centralised banks not serving 2 billion people around the world. The Blockchain allows payments to be checked and confirmed so there can be no double payments or lost payments, without there being a centralised authority. This technology therefore underpins an expansion of banking services to those currently shut out from the digital economy because of the existing banking infrastructure.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why the Ethereum Blockchain?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Humaniq app runs on the Ethereum platform, which is a way of running Blockchain-based, decentralised apps without unnecessary complexity and risk entailed in deploying a new Blockchain. The Ethereum Blockchain, which was first launched in the summer of 2015, is a well-established platform to provide secure banking without a central server. Using a ready and operating Blockchain allowed us to create a solution to the need for security for transactions quickly, without needless expenditure or loss of quality. This allows us to put more time and energy into concentrating on what matters most: our people-focused business model.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why invest in Humaniq?</strong></p>\r\n<p>We are pleased that so many people responded so positively to our Initial Coin Offering. Nearly 12,000 people have bought HMQ cryptocurrency because they believe in our vision to provide banking to the unbanked. Humaniq has been highlighted as in the top ten per cent of cryptocurrencies by value, with a market valuation of over $5m, and our ICO as one of the most successful in the last two years. Our vision will make HMQ the de facto currency for developing countries, the oil that runs the engines of their economies.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why did you hold an ICO?</strong></p>\r\n<p>We already had access to capital for our project but we believe it is fair to allow everybody to invest and to participate in Humaniq. We also wanted to help build our community and to have an opportunity to tell the story of Humaniq to more people in the media. Our belief that many would want to be involved and to support and help steer Humaniq proved well-founded: nearly 12,000 participated in the ICO held in April 2017 after reading our white paper. Our strategy&nbsp;is to focus on the massive potential of providing banking to the unbanked.</p>"},"beliefs":{"title":"Beliefs","id":"beliefs","level0":"about-humaniq","level1":"Getting Started","article":"<ul>\r\n<li>Humaniq believes in equality.

We would like it to be honoured by everybody joining and taking part in Humaniq.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Communicate and share.</strong> Humaniq can achieve our mission of bringing banking to the unbanked if we are aware of what is working well and what is working less well. Successes help us to show users, partners and investors potential uses and impacts of the Humaniq app and the HMQ tokens, knowledge that helps us to achieve our aims. And constructive criticism helps us to change things so that we can better serve all those currently shut out of opportunities to progress. The Humaniq team will also be as open as we can.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Respect others.</strong> Everybody matters and everybody has ideas and needs to be heard. We want to encourage feedback and suggestions in our community as Humaniq grows. We can all help to do this by being respectful of others and what they have to say. A peer-to-peer economy both tears down old ways of doing things and makes individual respect more important. And a community where everybody feels comfortable to express themselves and to contribute is a community that will learn, strengthen and flourish.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Collaborate</strong>. The beauty of the Humaniq app is that it underpins peer-to-peer collaboration. This allows partnerships between the many, and active participants rather than service user relationships people have with traditional banking institutions. This requires you all to pour your energies into this new way of working. So whether you are a Humaniq app user or a developer, we invite you to enter into the spirit of this new way of creating value and building an economy. The Humaniq team will respond positively. We want to facilitate peer-to-peer lending, partnership and support and to foster the provision of new services delivered by others through our app.</li>\r\n</ol>","category":"Getting Started"},{"title":"Core values","article":"<p>Humaniq believes in a humanitarian capitalism and in technology for good.</p>\r\n<p><br />Humaniq believes that people can pull themselves out of poverty with access to smartphones, to a network, and to finance.</p>\r\n<p><br />Humaniq believes in cryptocurrency that achieves value through expanding services to those not served and creating new opportunities in the 21st Century economy.</p>","category":"Getting Started"},{"title":"FAQ","article":"<p><strong>How is Humaniq different? Aren&rsquo;t you just another mobile wallet?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Humaniq is a cryptocurrency unlike any other. We are working to put currency into the hands of the 2bn unbanked people. The barriers to use are low, with voice and face recognition technologies used so that the uneducated and the undocumented can access the app and open an account.</p>\r\n<p><strong>It sounds accessible. But is this enough to succeed in putting cryptocurrency into the hands of the many?</strong></p>\r\n<p>With Humaniq, everybody can mint coins. Unlike with other cryptocurrencies, it is not about being the first to own the coins, or having access to specialised hardware or spending a lot on electricity. Everybody, once they have used their face to pass authentication, is rewarded with HMQ. Then, when they interact with the app, they earn more. The minting of coins will continue until we have 2 billion users.</p>\r\n<p><strong>But wasn&rsquo;t other cryptocurrency also aimed at developing countries?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Other crypto also uses Ethereum&rsquo;s custom-built Blockchain to provide new, safe and secure, currency. But it is not used in unbanked regions because it is limited in supply, because of relative usage complexity, and because it is not promoted. The transaction capacity limit of Bitcoin is 250 thousand, compared to PayPal&rsquo;s 100 million active accounts. We have researched the markets we are targeting, and recruited dozens of prominent bitcoiners living in developing countries to our Humaniq Ambassador Program. They are teaching people how to use Humaniq - and earn cryptocurrency for that.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why use the Blockchain to make payments?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Blockchain is a decentralised way of confirming transactions that steps into the breach that has been created by centralised banks not serving 2 billion people around the world. The Blockchain allows payments to be checked and confirmed so there can be no double payments or lost payments, without there being a centralised authority. This technology therefore underpins an expansion of banking services to those currently shut out from the digital economy because of the existing banking infrastructure.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why the Ethereum Blockchain?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Humaniq app runs on the Ethereum platform, which is a way of running Blockchain-based, decentralised apps without unnecessary complexity and risk entailed in deploying a new Blockchain. The Ethereum Blockchain, which was first launched in the summer of 2015, is a well-established platform to provide secure banking without a central server. Using a ready and operating Blockchain allowed us to create a solution to the need for security for transactions quickly, without needless expenditure or loss of quality. This allows us to put more time and energy into concentrating on what matters most: our people-focused business model.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why invest in Humaniq?</strong></p>\r\n<p>We are pleased that so many people responded so positively to our Initial Coin Offering. Nearly 12,000 people have bought HMQ cryptocurrency because they believe in our vision to provide banking to the unbanked. Humaniq has been highlighted as in the top ten per cent of cryptocurrencies by value, with a market valuation of over $5m, and our ICO as one of the most successful in the last two years. Our vision will make HMQ the de facto currency for developing countries, the oil that runs the engines of their economies.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why did you hold an ICO?</strong></p>\r\n<p>We already had access to capital for our project but we believe it is fair to allow everybody to invest and to participate in Humaniq. We also wanted to help build our community and to have an opportunity to tell the story of Humaniq to more people in the media. Our belief that many would want to be involved and to support and help steer Humaniq proved well-founded: nearly 12,000 participated in the ICO held in April 2017 after reading our white paper. Our strategy&nbsp;is to focus on the massive potential of providing banking to the unbanked.</p>","category":"Getting Started"},{"title":"Beliefs","article":"<ul>\r\n<li>Humaniq believes in equality.

There were in total 11,600 participants who made an average contribution of $430, raising $5.1m for the project. Each participant was able to buy 1,000 HMQ tokens or more. The majority of those supporting our vision and joining our community were motivated by our strategy and the huge untapped potential market of the 2bn unbanked people in the world.</p>\r\n<p>The HMQ tokens were then released on the 5th May, with a fifth issued for the HMQ team, including to invest in business development and marketing. Following the ICO, Humaniq has appeared on the following exchanges:Bittrex, Liqui, &nbsp;Yobit, C-CEX.

This series will cover all of the core concepts in short and easy-to-understand snippets.</p>\r\n<p>At its core, a blockchain is simply a ledger of transactions, which by itself is nothing ground-breaking. However, traditional forms of storage are completely centralized: when you put your money in a bank, for example, you are trusting it to store it safely for you. Its databases could be hacked, and no one would be able to notice it, except for the bank itself.</p>\r\n<p>Blockchain operates under the principle of decentralized and &ldquo;trustless&rdquo; storage. The integrity of the data is guaranteed by cryptography and math, which is verifiable by anyone. This is what trustless means: instead of trusting any single entity, like a bank, you rely on cryptographic rules that guarantee the safety of the data.</p>\r\n<p>However, it is useful to understand exactly what are these rules, and how blockchain achieves its goal of being tamper-proof.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/humaniq_media/7U7LeuHRmj1z2hZzbIU6FX\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 100%;\" /></p>","category":"English stories"},{"title":"Under the hood of blockchains","article":"<p>The most essential building block of blockchain technology is the concept of a \"cryptographic hash\". A hash function is a sort of one-way encryption mechanism: it is very easy to create a hash string from an input, but almost impossible to understand what&rsquo;s the input that generated a given hash.</p>\r\n<p>Hash strings, or simply hashes, look like this: 6b1cfe66c8f23dab339467ddfe8302d37cdcc2b9d280f148fed55379edffaf7a</p>\r\n<p>Every transaction in a blockchain system has its own unique hash, which functions as an identifier. To make the system work, the transactions must be grouped into single chunks called &ldquo;blocks&rdquo;, hence the term &ldquo;blockchain&rdquo;. Every block has its own unique hash identifier as well, but more on that later.</p>\r\n<p>A block must have something called a &ldquo;block header&rdquo;, a set of values representing its properties.

This hash is a unique representation of all of the transactions inside the block, and even the tiniest alteration in one of the components would produce a completely different Merkle Root.</p>\r\n<p>The Merkle root is then added together with the hash identifier of the previous block (and several other values) to create a new hash string: the identifier of the new block. Thus, every single block directly depends on the previous one, forming a chain.</p>\r\n<p></p>","category":"English stories"},{"title":"Ce qui se cache sous les blockchains","article":"<p>Le concept essentiel de la technologie de la blockchain, c&rsquo;est le concept du &laquo;hachage cryptographique&raquo;.

It might, but nobody knows the future. What is certain is that using digital currency saves you money today.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want to send or receive money? You lose so much in fees. Want to sell goods and services? You lose money to take payments by card. Want to borrow money for your future? Again, it is so expensive.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When your family send you money, banks take 7 cents of every dollar sent globally. They take even more in some areas - twice as much in South Africa. Banks issuing payment cards take around 50 cents of your money when you sell something for $20. And interest on loans can be even more: to borrow 5,000 Kenyan Shillings, you can pay 1,800 Kenyan Shillings!</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So if you want to send, charge or borrow money, how can you keep more of it? Cutting out the middleman is how. Banking on the Blockchain is the way to escape high charges.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When your family member sends you $100 in digital money, you pay pennies, not many dollars. And it&rsquo;s only a fixed, small fee for taking payment by digital money - $1 on average in Bitcoin as we enter July 2018. And the Blockchain can cut the high cost of loans too. How does the Blockchain do all this? </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply put, it means less administration - no bank buildings and fewer staff. The Blockchain can save you money as you deal directly with other people.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/humaniq_media/7U7LeuHRmj1z2hZzbIU695\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 100%;\" /></span></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>","category":"English stories"},{"title":"Why Crypto can better than real money","article":"<p>Cryptocurrency (which is HMQ, Bitcoin, Etherum and many more) has many advantages over &lsquo;real&rsquo; or old money &ndash; and the possibilities for this new, better money &ndash; like HMQ &ndash; are growing every day.</p>\r\n<p>Cryptocurrency supplied by its users and investors is valuable in a way old money can never be.

A blockchain frees people from the need for any big, central authority in order to simply transact and speak with each other. It is a shared, decentralised database run by a peer-to-peer network of computers or nodes, as opposed to the central server that runs traditional applications and websites. Every request to make a transaction, such as when one person agrees to lend money to another who wishes to borrow, is information that is distributed across this network, not stored in one place. The result is a permanent, incorruptible and secure record of each and every transaction, stored across the network publically and chronologically on what is referred to as a &lsquo;digital ledger&rsquo; in &lsquo;blocks&rsquo; of data.</p>","category":"Crypto Basics"},{"title":"How transactions are verified","article":"<p>A blockchain, as a decentralised network, liberates people from a reliance on the old, centralised banks, opening up banking services to those currently able to access them. To make this possible, however, there is a challenge that needs to be overcome. The shared, distributed record of the fact that all the transactions have been made requires some of the computing power of those providing the computers, or nodes, to run the system. In order to achieve this, each person who offers their hardware and storage space for the purpose of sustaining the blockchain is rewarded with cryptocurrency. The amount that they are paid is calculated by an internal, virtual machine called gas, which efficiently and fairly identifies the relative cost of different computing operations, in order to incentivise contributions.</p>","category":"Crypto Basics"},{"title":"HMQ and Ethereum","article":"<p>HMQ is the Humaniq cryptocurrency token. The Ethereum platform facilitated the launch of our currency for the global unbanked by providing a common standard. This ERC20 standard allowed HMQ to immediately work with all decentralised apps that also conform to the standard, which means that if you use any of a number of mobile wallet such as, for example, Coinbase and Jaxx you can hold HMQ. It also means that HMQ are easily exchangeable with other cryptocurrency tokens that follow the ERC20 rules, including Ether, the Ethereum token. Humaniq is still young: our ICO (initial coin offer) was only held in April 2017 and the Humaniq app launch is scheduled for August. But HMQ can already be exchanged with other currencies in a number of online exchanges: SpaceBTC, Yobit, Bittrexx Liqui and C-CEX.</p>","category":"Crypto Basics"},{"title":"Why Ethereum?","article":"<p>The Ethereum Blockchain provided a ready and operating blockchain for Humaniq to effectively provide banking to the unbanked with a new, decentralised app. In addition, it also offers smart contract functionality that facilitate online contractual agreements within the Humaniq app, making peer-to-peer lending and other collaborations between Humaniq users easy. They are smart because repayments and other transactions that Humaniq users commit to are automatically executed. This allows the expansion of microfinance, which to date has relied on intermediaries charging fees. The Ethereum Blockchain also underpins an encrypted messaging system between Humaniq app users, which provides privacy and security.</p>","category":"Crypto Basics"},{"title":"Ethereum vs Bitcoin","article":"<p>Blockchains are still best-known for being the medium that made the cryptocurrency Bitcoin possible. The Bitcoin Blockchain was introduced in 2009 for the purpose of tracking all transactions made in that digital money. Blockchain technology potentially is suitable for recording far more than the amount of cryptocurrency being held and used, including agreements between people. Other providers have since launched other blockchains in order to cater for such wider applications, including Ethereum, which in 2016 launched a new, open-source, blockchain as a platform for any applications that cut out middle-men and widen access to services.. Ethereum facilitates a blockchain-based economy because every new start-up does not need to deploy their own blockchain, with the possibility of revolutionising a range of financial services, including credit and insurance.</p>","category":"Crypto Basics"},{"title":"Why use a blockchain?","article":"<p>Blockchains offer a way to confirm that transactions have taken place without any go-between, such as a traditional bank, needed to carry out, check, and record everything. This allows banking services to be offered everywhere, including to people and in areas that are not served by banks, and so are shut out of the 21st Century economy&rsquo;s opportunities. It also opens up the possibility of a new, peer-to-peer, sharing economy, where people can directly send and receive, lend and borrow money to and from each other, rather than relying on financial industry and its fee-charging field representatives. This way of providing financial services is not only more democratic and accessible, it also offers better security, because there is no central server for hackers to attack, and the information on transactions cannot be tampered with.</p>","category":"Crypto
