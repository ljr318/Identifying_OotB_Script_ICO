           THE ESCAPE TOKEN PROJECT IS A PROMISING PLATFORM UNITING THE COMMUNITY OF ESCAPE GAMES ENTHUSIASTS AND VR ENTERTAINMENT ON THE BASIS OF THE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGIES.
          </p>
          <p>
           On the 23rd of February at 23:00 GMT the Pre-ICO of Escape Token project was finished. During the token presale we offered the 20% bonus to every purchase. We havenât reached the Hard Cap of the project. However, now we have decided to cancel the launching of the main stage of the ICO and returned all investments in full.

          There is no prior market for Escape Tokens and the TGE may not result in an active
                            or liquid market for the Escape Tokens
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Prior to the TGE, there has been no public market for the Escape Tokens. Although
                            the Company will use reasonable endeavors to seek the approval for availability of the
                            Escape Tokens for trading on a cryptocurrency exchange, there is no assurance
                            that such approval will be obtained. Furthermore, even if such approval is granted
                            by a cryptocurrency exchange, there is no assurance that an active
                            or liquid trading market for the Escape Tokens will develop or if developed,
                            be sustained after the Escape Tokens have been made available for trading on such
                            cryptocurrency exchange. There is also no assurance that the market price of the
                            Escape Tokens will not decline below the original purchase price (the âPurchase Priceâ). The
                            Purchase Price may not be indicative of the market price of the Escape Tokens
                            after they have been made available for trading on a cryptocurrency exchange.
        </p>
        <p>
         A Escape Token is not a currency issued by any central bank or national,
                            supra-national or quasi-national organization, nor is it backed by any
                            hard assets or other credit. The Company is not responsible for nor does it pursue
                            the circulation and trading of Escape Tokens on the market. Trading of Escape
                            Tokens will merely depend on the consensus on its value between the relevant
                            market participants, and no one is obliged to purchase any Escape Token from
                            any holder of the Escape Token, including the purchasers, not does anyone guarantee the
                            liquidity or market price of Escape Tokens to any extent at any
                            time.
        </p>
        <p>
         Furthermore, Escape Tokens may not be resold to purchasers who are citizens or permanent
                            residents of Chine, the United States of America (including its territories and
                            possessions), or any other jurisdiction where the purchase of Escape Tokens may be in violation
                            of applicable laws. Accordingly, the Company cannot ensure that there will be any
                            demand or market for Escape Tokens, or that the Purchase Price is indicative
                            of the market price of Escape Tokens after they have been made available for
                            trading on a cryptocurrency exchange.

          Future sales or issuance of the Escape Tokens could materially and

         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Any future sale or issuance of the Escape Tokens would increase the supply of Escape
                            Tokens in the market and this may result in a downward price pressure on the
                            Escape Token. The sale or distribution of a significant number of Escape
                            Tokens outside of the TGE (including but not limited to the sales of Escape

                            and/or users of the Escape platform), or the mere perception that such further
                            sales or issuance may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of the
                            Escape Tokens.

         Negative publicity involving the Company, the Escape platform, the Escape Tokens or any

                            volume and interactions among the users and the Escape platform, there is no assurance
                            you personally will receive any part of the rewards. This is because the ability
                            of the Company to pay any reward to you will depend on the future

        </p>
        <p>
         The value of, and demand for, the Escape Tokens hinges heavily on the performance
                            of the Escape platform. There is no assurance that the Escape platform will
                            gain traction after its launch and achieve any commercial success. Although the Company has
                            performed some testing, including QA-testing of the Escape platform with relatively
                            positive results, the Escape platform has not been fully developed and finalized and is subject
                            to further changes, updates and adjustments prior to its launch. Such changes may
                            result in unexpected and unforeseen effects on its projected appeal to users,
                            possibly due to the failure to meet usersâ preconceived expectations based on the
                            beta version, and hence impact its success. Limited usage of the Escape platform and
                            potential lack of trust for its crowdsourced predictive accuracy would impact the
                            public demand for the Escape Tokens and correspondingly the trading price of the Escape
                            Tokens.

        <p>
         While the Company has made every effort to provide a realistic estimate, there is also
                            no assurance that the cryptocurrencies raised in the TGE will be sufficient
                            for the development of the Escape platform. For the foregoing or any other reason,
                            the development of the Escape platform and its launch may not be completed and
                            there is no assurance that it will be launched at all. As such,
                            distributed Escape Tokens may hold little worth or value, and this would impact its
                            trading price.

         The Company will make every effort to ensure that the funds received will be securely

                            measures, there is no assurance that there will be no theft of the
                            cryptocurrencies as a result of hacks, sophisticated cyber-attacks,
                            distributed denials of service or errors, vulnerabilities or defects on the

        <p>
         The Escape platform is developed, operated and maintained by the Escape Foundation.
                            Any events or circumstances which adversely affect the Escape Foundation or any of its
                            successor operating entities (collectively referred to herein as âEscapeâ) may
                            have a corresponding adverse effect on the Escape platform. Such adverse effects
                            would correspondingly have an impact on the utility, liquidity, and the trading

         Escape may be materially and adversely affected if it fails to effectively
                            manage its operations as its business develops and evolves, which would have a direct
                            impact on its ability to maintain the Escape platform. The technology and
                            cryptocurrency industries, and the markets in which Escape competes have grown rapidly
                            over the past four years and continue to evolve in response to new
                            technological advances, changing business models and other factors. As a result of this
                            constantly changing environment, Escape may face operational difficulties in adjusting
                            to the changes, and the sustainability of Escape will depend on its ability
                            to manage its operations and ensure that it hires qualified and competent
                            employees, and provides proper training for its personnel. As its business evolves,
                            Escape must also expand and adapt its operational infrastructure. Escapeâs business relies
                            on its blockchain-based software systems, cryptocurrency wallets or other related
                            token storage mechanisms, blockchain technology and smart contract technology, if used,
                            and on machine learning and artificial intelligence platforms. All of these
                            systems and tools represent complex, costly, and rapidly changing technical infrastructure.
                            In order to demonstrate continued ability to effectively manage technical
                            support infrastructure for the Escape platform, Escape will need to continue to upgrade
                            and improve its data systems and other operational systems, procedures and controls. These

                            not control. If Escape is unable to adapt its systems and organization in a timely,
                            efficient and cost-effective manner to accommodate changing circumstances, its
                            business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
                            If the third parties whom Escape relies on are subject to a security
                            breach or otherwise suffer disruptions that impact the services Escape uses, the
                            integrity and availability of its internal information could be compromised, which
                            may consequently cause the loss of confidential or proprietary information, and
                            economic loss. The loss of financial, labor or other resources, and any other
                            adverse effect on Escapeâs business, financial condition and operations, would have a direct
                            adverse effect on Escapeâs ability to maintain the Escape platform. Any adverse
                            effects affecting Escapeâs business or technology are likely to also adversely
                            impact the utility, liquidity, and trading price of the Escape Tokens.
        </p>
        <p>
         Escape may experience system failures, unplanned interruptions in its network or services,
                            hardware or software defects, security breaches or other causes that could
                            adversely affect Escapeâs infrastructure network, and/or the Escape platform

         Escape is not able to anticipate when there would be occurrences of hacks,
                            cyber- attacks, distributed denials of service or errors, vulnerabilities or defects
                            in the Escape platform, in the smart contracts, if used, or on the
                            Ethereum or any other blockchain technology. Such events may include, for example,
                            flaws in programming or source code leading to exploitation or abuse
                            thereof. Escape may not be able to detect such hacks, cyber-attacks, distributed
                            denials of service errors vulnerabilities or defects in a timely manner,
                            and may not have sufficient resources to efficiently cope with multiple service
                            incidents happening simultaneously or in rapid succession.
        </p>
        <p>
         Escapeâs network or services, which would include the Escape platform, could be disrupted
                            by numerous events, including natural disasters, equipment breakdown, network
                            connectivity downtime, power losses, or even intentional disruptions of its
                            services, such as disruptions caused by software viruses or attacks by unauthorized
                            users, some of which are beyond Escapeâs control. Although Escape has taken steps
                            against malicious attacks on its platform or its infrastructure, which are
                            critical for the maintenance of the Escape platform, there can be no assurance
                            that cyber-attacks, such as distributed denials of service, will not be attempted
                            in the future, that Companyâs enhanced security measures will be effective. Escape
                            may be prone to attacks on its infrastructure intended to steal
                            information about its technology, financial data or user information or take other
                            actions that would be damaging to the Company and/or holders of the Escape
                            Tokens. Any significant breach of the Companyâs security measures or other
                            disruptions resulting in a compromise of the usability, stability and
                            security of the Escape platform may adversely affect the utility, liquidity and/or
                            trading price of the Escape Tokens.

         Escape current infrastructure network is in part established through servers which
                            it owns and houses at the location facilities of third parties, and servers
                            that it rents at data center facilities of third parties. If the Company

                            or at all, Escape may be required to transfer its servers to a new
                            data center facility, and may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection
                            with the relocation. These facilities are also vulnerable to damage or interruption
                            from, among others, natural disasters, arson, terrorist attacks, power losses, and
                            telecommunication failures. Additionally, the third party providers of such facilities
                            may suffer a breach of security as a result of third party action,
                            employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and a third party may obtain
                            unauthorized access to the data in such servers. As techniques used to obtain
                            unauthorized access to, or to sabotage systems change frequently and
                            generally are not recognized until launched against a target, Escape and the providers
                            of such facilities may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement
                            adequate preventive measures. Any such security breaches or damages which occur which

          The Company or the Escape Tokens may be affected by newly implemented
                            regulations
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         The blockchain industry as a whole has seen numerous regulatory authorities across
                            jurisdictions taking action, speaking out, and implementing regulatory regimes which govern
                            blockchain or blockchain markets. The Company or the Escape Tokens may be affected
                            by newly implemented regulations relating to the blockchain industry, including
                            having to take measures to comply with such regulations, or having to deal
                            with queries, notices, requests or enforcement actions by regulatory authorities,
                            which may come at a substantial cost and may also require substantial
                            modifications to the Escape platform. This may impact the appeal of the Escape
                            platform for users and result in decreased usage of the Escape platform and the
                            Escape Tokens. Further, should the costs (financial or otherwise) of complying
                            with such newly implemented regulations exceed a certain threshold, maintaining the
                            Escape platform may no longer be commercially viable and the Company may opt to discontinue
                            the Escape platform and/or the Escape Tokens. Further, it is difficult to predict
                            how or whether governments or regulatory authorities may implement any changes to laws
                            and regulations affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the
                            Escape platform and the Escape Tokens. Escape may also have to cease operations in a jurisdiction
                            that makes it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or make it commercially
                            unviable or undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) or license(s)
                            to operate in such jurisdiction.
