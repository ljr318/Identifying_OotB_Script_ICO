          <br/>
          The CryptoWorld.Vip (CWV) public chain is the world's first integrated main
                  chain based on the multi-chain mechanism. It is a blockchain 3.0 product. The CryptoWorld game is
                  a blockchain world created on the CWV chain based on a 1:1 mapping to the real world. Buildings
                  in the CryptoWorld [game] access different chains and blockchain services based on their
                  functions.

           <span class="more">
            <br/>
            CWV combines Raft+DPos algorithms with alliance nodes and the integrated
                  main chain technique of individual public chains, adopting a better technical framework.
            <br/>
            CryptoWorld is an open platform of inter-chain networks made up of cross-chain free conversion
                  agreement, smart contracts, SDK for Docker operations, shared account book systems and a
                  decentralized wallet system. It is an open platform of blockchain applications and a multi-chain
                  integrated network with side matchmaking technology supporting cross-chain transactions. The core
                  concept of CryptoWorldâs inter-chain network mainly involves two parts:
            <br/>
            1) a decentralized wallet system, supporting both an in-house CryptoWorld wallet and any hot or
                  cold storage wallets from third parties;
            <br/>
            2) a decentralized transaction docking system. CryptoWorld supports cross-chain free
                  Token-to-Token conversion agreement.

           <span class="more">
            <br/>
            Due to factors including; low market penetration, lack of seamless
                  connectivity, missing compatibility between blockchains, and the effort required for the
                  accessibility of the DApp (decentralised applications), it is currently difficult for users to
                  fully experience the many services provided by blockchain technology.
            <br/>
            With the rise of blockchain applications, users will require a portal that allows them to
                  effectively experience blockchain applications through visualized scenarios. The virtual space
                  created by the CryptoWorld.Vip Platform provides the user with a visual interaction between
                  themself and the blockchain technologies through the form of digital assets. Users will be able
                  to participate in social networking, financial transactions, gaming, and many other activities in
                  the virtual world, all with blockchain serving as its infrastructure. The CryptoWorld.Vip
                  Platform is envisioned as an entry-level platform for gaming related cross-chain applications.

                  applications in the early stage, then extending this to other applications with the growth of the

            <span class="more">
             <br/>
             The game platform in CryptoWorld that simulates asset transaction maps real
                  estate in the real world in 1:1 mapping to ensure consistency with real estate in the real world.
                  The quantity of virtual real estate is limited. Buildings access different blockchains and
                  blockchain services according to their function attributes and provide users with virtual
                  experience of blockchains penetrated to the real world. Real estates consist of landmark
                  buildings, functional entry buildings, and common buildings. The building attributes (with
                  personal geographical location, size, and function) determine the values of buildings and
                  therefore enable transactions among users.
             <br/>
             The game platform maps functions of virtual buildings in the real world to corresponding
                  games (that is, scenario-based applications) to provide reality simulation game services for
                  CryptoWorld users. By using CWV that can be circulated on the platform, users can conveniently
                  consume services same as those in the real world. For example, play games in an entertainment
                  city, watch live broadcast of sport events in a stadium, buy licensed video resources from a
                  cinema, or buy online courses from a "school".
             <br/>
             What's more, users can define the modes for interaction with others; playing games, making
                  transactions, and communication on the platform. In this way, each user can transfer from a
                  consumer to an operator. For example, the entertainment city has the game function. A user who
                  purchases the real estate can access the game chain to operate various games. The transaction
                  exchange center accesses the decentralized transaction platform to provide token and transaction
                  exchange services for all users. The casino has the quiz game operation function. Quiz game
                  blockchains under a cooperation agreement with the platform will be incorporated to develop the
                  casino businesses on the platform. CryptoWorld has rich game operation modes, enabling users to
                  obtain benefits together with the platform. Various functional buildings meet the operation
                  scenario requirements of different blockchain applications.
             <br/>
             In the first phase of the game platform, it is planned that the America map is online. A huge
                  entertainment city will be provided in the virtual world, where, landmark buildings, such as
                  Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, entertainment center of Las Vegas, and Hollywood of Los
                  Angeles are available. In the preliminary stage, the platform focuses on games. With optimization
                  of the ecosystem and expansion of the user scale, the platform will add other elements related to
                  our daily life, such as film, sport, education, and culture, ensuring that CryptoWorld comes from
                  but excels the real life. The platform is a subversive platform for life and entertainment value
                  creation. It provides new life concepts that are hard to be realized in the real world.

                    distributed. By calling APIs of Google Maps, a user can draw the longitude and latitude in the
                    CryptoWorld real estate database. The real estate displayed on Google Maps is the asset owned by
                    the user. To ensure fairness, the drawing process is assisted by a miner in a random manner.</br>
                    <br>2) Exchange for real estates using purchased areas: Users can purchase an area by bidding
                    from the real estate exchange on the platform every hour. Those who obtain the area can exchange
                    for a real estate with the same area from the real estate exchange. Houses in different locations
                    will consume different cost resources, which are settled using CWV.</br>
                    <br>3) Listed trading: The real estate exchange supports listed trading of resold real estates
                    between users.</br>

            <span class="more">
             The CWV public chain is an underlaying blockchain technology developed by the
                  CryptoWorld project team, which is the world's first integrated main chain based on the
                  multi-chain mechanism. It adopts the Raft + DPoS consensus algorithm, which enables it to
                  dramatically improve the read and write throughput of the blockchain while maintaining secure
                  and efficient consensus mechanisms as well as distributed accounting. In addition, CWV provides
                  a speed force-based transmission network for fast transaction and owns the capability of
                  processing 100,000 transactions. It greatly improves the main chain bearing capability and
                  provides more applications with richer interactive experience for users. CWV provides the open
                  and cross-chain transaction APIs, smart contracts, container running SDKs, and shared
                  accounting systems, constructing a comprehensive development platform that supports blockchain
                  applications.
